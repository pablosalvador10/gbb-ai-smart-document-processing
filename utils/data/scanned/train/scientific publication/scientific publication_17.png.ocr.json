Cline Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724\nSummary\nCalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca- MKII) can be regulated by synaptic activity and could therefore be involved in activity-dependent control of neuronal growth. We tested whether increased CaM- Kil activity in postsynaptic optic tectal neurons can modify the development of retinotectal axons in Xeno- pus. The elaboration of individual presynaptic retinal axons was observed in vivo before and up to 3 days after infecting the tectal cells with vaccinia virus car- rying the gene for constitutively active truncated CaM- KII (tCaMKII). Elevated postsynaptic CaMKII activity prevented the axons from developing the complexity of normal arbors by increasing the normal rate of branch retractions. Some effects of tCaMKII on arbor morphology were seen 1 day after infection, but they became more dramatic by the third day. The results suggest that postsynaptic CaMKII plays a role in the development of presynaptic arbor structure.\nIntroduction\nThe formation of neural circuits requires the coordinated development of presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites. Activity-dependent mechanisms that operate in both anterograde and retrograde directions across the synapse are likely to be important in controlling neuronal growth and synaptogenesis (Goodman and Shatz, 1993; Jessell and Kandel, 1993; Davis and Mur- phey, 1994). Evidence for such coordinated control of neuronal growth and circuit formation is strong in the visual system of frogs, where changing tectal cell N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activity dis- rupts the topographic organization of afferent inputs (Cline et al., 1987; Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1989; Scherer and Udin, 1989), alters retinal axon morphology (Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1990a) and presynaptic structure (Yen et al., 1993, 1995) and changes axon arbor branch dynamics (O'Rourke et al., 1994). However, the signal transduction pathways within the postsynaptic neurons that underlie such activity-dependent changes in neuronal structure are not clear. One possibility is that the rise in intracellular Ca? following synaptic activity activates the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-depen- dent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) in tectal cells. CaM- Kil has been implicated in the control of neuronal growth and neuronal plasticity (Scott and Soderling, 1992; Schulman, 1993).\nCaMKII is activated by Ca2\"/calmodulin binding to the regulatory domain of the protein. This results in autophosphorylation that makes the enzyme indepen- dent of Ca2/calmodulin (Schulman, 1993). Increases in intracellular Ca2+ following activation of voltage-gated\nCa2 channels, ligand-gated channels, or release of Ca?\" from intracellular stores can all result in autophosphory- lation and prolonged activation of CaMKII (Hanson and Schulman, 1992; Scott and Soderling, 1992; Schulman, 1993). In this way, brief changes in intracellular Ca2+ can lead to relatively long-lasting increases in CaMKII activity (Miller and Kennedy, 1986; Lisman and Goldring, 1988)\nCaMKII has been shown to be important in several forms of synaptic plasticity. In Drosophila, inhibition of CaMKII activity by the induction of an inhibitory peptide impairs learning (Griffith et al., 1993, 1994) and modifies synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (Wang et al., 1994). CaMKII is required for long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocam- pus (Malenka et al., 1989; Malinow et al., 1989), and increased CaMKII activity in postsynaptic neurons po- tentiates synaptic transmission (Pettit et al., 1994). Knockout mice lacking Â«-CaMKII are also deficient in some types of learning (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b) and presynaptic forms of plasticity (Chapman et al., 1995). Presynaptic CaMKII activity may promote neurotrans- mitter release (Lin et al., 1990; Llinas et al., 1991). CaMKII is a major constituent of the postsynaptic density (Ken- nedy et al., 1983) and may influence synaptic plasticity by phosphorylating @-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors (McGlade- McCulloh et al., 1992), or cytoskeletal proteins (Jeffer- son and Schulman, 1991), or by regulating nitric oxide synthase activity (Nakane et al., 1991).\nThe role of CaMKIl in structural plasticity is less clear. High levels of CaMKII activity correlate with peaks of neuronal growth and synaptogenesis in several sys- tems, including the visual system (Scholz et al., 1988; Jensen et al., 1991; Jia et al., 1992). Some in vitro studies indicate that increased CaMKIl activity increases neurite outgrowth (Goshima et al., 1993) and that decreased CaMKil decreases neurite growth (Cabell and Audesirk, 1993). However, Jian et al. (1994) reported that blocking CaMKIl has no effect on retinal axon outgrowth in vitro. Manipulating kinase activity in vivo permits one to as- sess the effect of kinase activity on the coordinated development of the pre- and postsynaptic partners. In Drosophila, blocking kinase activity in vivo with an inhib- itory peptide increases neuronal growth at the neuro- muscular junction (Wang et al., 1994). The growth of retinal axons is also regulated in vivo by the chronic application of kinase inhibitors in tadpoles (Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1990b). In these last experiments on retinal axon growth, CaMKII activity was probably modified in both the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, so that it is difficult to define the role of pre- or postsynaptic kinase activity in the development of retinal axons and tectal neurons. Targeted manipulation of kinase activity in tectal neurons could reveal the possible role of post- synaptic CaMKII activity in the coordinated control of neuronal growth.\nVaccinia virus has been well characterized as a vector for use in cell culture (Moss, 1991) and has more recently been used to infect targeted populations of neurons

Elevated postsynaptic CaMKII activity prevented the axons from developing the complexity of normal arbors by increasing the normal rate of branch retractions.

Activity-dependent mechanisms that operate in both anterograde and retrograde directions across the synapse are likely to be important in controlling neuronal growth and synaptogenesis (Goodman and Shatz, 1993; Jessell and Kandel, 1993; Davis and Mur- phey, 1994). Evidence for such coordinated control of neuronal growth and circuit formation is strong in the visual system of frogs, where changing tectal cell N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activity dis- rupts the topographic organization of afferent inputs (Cline et al., 1987; Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1989; Scherer and Udin, 1989), alters retinal axon morphology (Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1990a) and presynaptic structure (Yen et al., 1993, 1995) and changes axon arbor branch dynamics (O'Rourke et al., 1994). However, the signal transduction pathways within the postsynaptic neurons that underlie such activity-dependent changes in neuronal structure are not clear. One possibility is that the rise in intracellular Ca? following synaptic activity activates the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-depen- dent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) in tectal cells. CaM- Kil has been implicated in the control of neuronal growth and neuronal plasticity (Scott and Soderling, 1992; Schulman, 1993)."},{"spans":[{"offset":2617,"length":265}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[132,874,397,871,397,938,133,941]}],"content":"CaMKII is activated by Ca2\"/calmodulin binding to the regulatory domain of the protein.

In Drosophila, inhibition of CaMKII activity by the induction of an inhibitory peptide impairs learning (Griffith et al., 1993, 1994) and modifies synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (Wang et al., 1994). CaMKII is required for long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocam- pus (Malenka et al., 1989; Malinow et al., 1989), and increased CaMKII activity in postsynaptic neurons po- tentiates synaptic transmission (Pettit et al., 1994). Knockout mice lacking Â«-CaMKII are also deficient in some types of learning (Silva et al., 1992a, 1992b) and presynaptic forms of plasticity (Chapman et al., 1995). Presynaptic CaMKII activity may promote neurotrans- mitter release (Lin et al., 1990; Llinas et al., 1991). CaMKII is a major constituent of the postsynaptic density (Ken- nedy et al., 1983) and may influence synaptic plasticity by phosphorylating @-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors (McGlade- McCulloh et al., 1992), or cytoskeletal proteins (Jeffer- son and Schulman, 1991), or by regulating nitric oxide synthase activity (Nakane et al., 1991)."},{"spans":[{"offset":4474,"length":1471}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[416,546,682,543,685,895,420,898]}],"content":"The role of CaMKIl in structural plasticity is less clear. High levels of CaMKII activity correlate with peaks of neuronal growth and synaptogenesis in several sys- tems, including the visual system (Scholz et al., 1988; Jensen et al., 1991; Jia et al., 1992). Some in vitro studies indicate that increased CaMKIl activity increases neurite outgrowth (Goshima et al., 1993) and that decreased CaMKil decreases neurite growth (Cabell and Audesirk, 1993). However, Jian et al. (1994) reported that blocking CaMKIl has no effect on retinal axon outgrowth in vitro. Manipulating kinase activity in vivo permits one to as- sess the effect of kinase activity on the coordinated development of the pre- and postsynaptic partners. In Drosophila, blocking kinase activity in vivo with an inhib- itory peptide increases neuronal growth at the neuro- muscular junction (Wang et al., 1994). The growth of retinal axons is also regulated in vivo by the chronic application of kinase inhibitors in tadpoles (Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1990b). In these last experiments on retinal axon growth, CaMKII activity was probably modified in both the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, so that it is difficult to define the role of pre- or postsynaptic kinase activity in the development of retinal axons and tectal neurons. Targeted manipulation of kinase activity in tectal neurons could reveal the possible role of post- synaptic CaMKII activity in the coordinated control of neuronal growth."},{"spans":[{"offset":5946,"length":168}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[421,898,685,895,685,935,421,938]}],"content":"Vaccinia virus has been well characterized as a vector for use in cell culture (Moss, 1991) and has more recently been used to infect targeted populations of neurons in"}],"styles":[],"contentFormat":"text","sections":[{"spans":[{"offset":69,"length":6045}],"elements":["/paragraphs/1","/paragraphs/2","/sections/1","/sections/2"]},{"spans":[{"offset":267,"length":954}],"elements":["/paragraphs/3","/paragraphs/4"]},{"spans":[{"offset":1222,"length":4892}],"elements":["/paragraphs/5","/paragraphs/6","/paragraphs/7","/paragraphs/8","/paragraphs/9","/paragraphs/10","/paragraphs/11"]}]}}
