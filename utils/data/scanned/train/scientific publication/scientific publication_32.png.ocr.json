Lee, Shelly A. Arnold, Paul J. Birckbichler, Manford K. Patterson, Jr., Bassam M. Fraij, Yutaka Takeuchi and Henry A. Carter The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., Biomedical Division. Ardmore, OK (USA)\n(Received 5 January 1993)\nKey words: Transglutaminase; Site-directed mutagenesis; GTPase; GTPase activity\nFansglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) catalyze an acyl-transfer reaction between peptide-bound glutamine residues and primary Sines, including the e-amino group of lysine residues in protein. Purified human crythrocyte transglutaminase was found to che another activity, i.e., GTP hydrolysis. Treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide, a cysteine-directed reagent, caused a % loss of TGase activity within 8 min, but no significant loss of GTPase activity. Cys-277, a known residue which is selectively Codified by iodoacetamide, was replaced with Ser by site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of the Cys-277 in the osglutaminase/GTPase activities. Wild-type cDNA, coding for human endothelial cell transglutaminase, and its C277S-mutated EDNA were cloned into a plasmid vector that contained a promotor from phage T7, and then expressed in Escherichia coli. The wild-type recombinant enzyme was indistinguishable from human erythrocyte transglutaminase in mobility on a SDS-polyacryl- alde gel, immunoreactivity and catalytic activities for transglutaminase and GTPase. However, the recombinant enzyme was not Hocked at the N-terminal alanine residue, as is the case in the naturally occurring erythrocyte enzyme. The C2775 mutant hyme showed no transglutaminase activity, but had Kg and kea values for GTPase activity that were comparable to those of d-type recombinant and natural erythrocyte enzymes. These results demonstrate that Cys-277 is essential for transglutaminase ativity, but not for GTPase activity, and that N-terminal blocking of tissue-type transglutaminase is not critical for either ransglutaminase or GTPase activities.\nLatroduction\nTGases (protein-glutamine:amine y-glutamyltrans- ferase, EC 2.3.2.13) catalyze, in the presence of Ca2+, an acyl-transfer reaction between peptide-bound glu- tamine residues and the primary amino group in vari- ous molecules and are found in most tissues and body fluids [1,2]. Plasma and epidermal TGases are known to carry out stabilization of the fibrin clot in hemostasis [3-5] and the formation of the cornified envelope in terminally-differentiated epidermal keratinocytes [6], respectively. Tissue-type TGase has also been impli- cated in cell growth regulation [7,8], differentiation\n[9-11]. apoptosis [12] and protection against killer cells [13].\nTissue-type TGase from guinea-pig liver has been the subject of extensive studies for its molecular and catalytic properties, and the reaction mechanism of the enzyme has been proposed [14]. TGase activity is mod- ulated by metal ions and chemicals [15-18]. It has been reported that TGase activity of tissue-type TGase from guinea-pig liver [19], human erythrocyte [20] and rat liver [21] was inhibited by GTP. Our recent studies have demonstrated that purified guinca-pig liver TGase has GTPase activity [22].\nOur initial question was whether or not the enzyme molecule has a common active site for the GTPase/ TGase activities. In preliminary experiments, we found that immunoaffinity-purified human erythrocyte TGase, another tissue-type enzyme also has GTPase activity, and by treatment of the enzyme with iodoacet- amide at reaction conditions [23] for the selective car- bamidomethylation of the cysteine residue at position 277 [24], the GTPase activity was inhibited slightly and\n( orespondence tu [present address): K.N.
