Icupeptin. N.IN-(1-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyh)-L -leucyl)amino-4. guanidinobutane (E-6-7) and the drazomethanes benzyloxy- carbonyl (Z)-Phe-Phe-chazomethane (CHN) and Z-Phe- Ala- CHN, have been shown to inhibit effectively the lysosomal cysteine proteinases m rare (Kirsebke & Shaw. 1981. Barrett es af .. 1982. Rich. 1986) The efficacy with which these inhibitors reach and inhibit their target enzymes m rire or in cell culture. however, has not been determined Studies using these inhibitors have looked at the effect of time on the onset of inhibition of protein degradation as an indication of the mode of entry of the inhibitors. This approach has produced conflicung results on their mechanism of uptake.\nE-64 and the related epoxide inhibitors EP-475 for E-64c. N. [N'-[L-3-trans-carboxyouirane .2.carbonyl)-L-leucy]]- 3-methyl- butylamine: and E64d : \\-JA-11-3-Franc-ethoxycarbonyloxirane- 2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-3-methylbuty lamine: are irreversible inhibitors of the lysosomal cysteine proteinases and the cylosolic cysteine proteinases: the calpains (Hanada et al., 1978, Bartett ev al . 1982. Parkes er af .. 1985, Tamar el af .. 1986) Administration of both E-64 and EP-475 to live animals led to decreased activity of cathepsins B and H after extraction from the tissues (Noda er al . 1981. Barcos er of .. 19881 When administered orally m rirn. EP-475 was shown to prolong the life of dystrophie animals in a dose-dependent manner (Tamar et al., 1987) Despite these studies. how these compounds reach their target enzymes is unresolved\nLeupeptin, an inhibitor of both senne and cysteine proteinascs. mhabits basal protein turnover hy 30-40\" .. (Dean, 1979) Imual experiments looking at the inhibitory characterstics of this compound seemed to indicate that it rapidly entered cells by diffusion. since its effect was observed without any discernible lag time (Simon et al . 1977. Seglen, et al., 1979) In confhet with these results. Nonaka and colleagues (1982} administered\n[''C]leupepim orally to dystrophie chickens and looked at the distribution of {\"CHieupeptin. They found that negligible amounts of the inhibitor had entered the sarcolemma and concluded that leupeptin penetrates poorly in whole animals The mode of entry of leupeptin is therefore controversial and requires further investigation\nDiazomethanes have been shown to inhibit protein turnover in Isolated rat hepatocytes, showing maximal inhibition after 2 h (Grinde. 1983). Another study demonstrated, however, that inhibition of protein turnover in isolated mouse macrophages by Z-Phe-Ala-CHN, and Z-Phe-Phe-CHN, was observed after a delay of 2 h. and it was concluded that pinocytosis was the major mechanism of uptake for these inhibitors (Shaw & Dean, 1980)\nThe above techniques are indirect in that they usually measure the effect of the proteinase inhibitors on the enzymes after homogenization of the tissues. We already know that this approach results in the exposure of lysosomal proteinases to extracellular and cytoplasmic inhibitors and it could also result In added synthetic mhibitors that do not penetrate cells contact- ing the enzymes after homogenization. We have developed a more direct approach using the diazomeihane inhibitor. Z-['\"1hodo- Tyr-Ala-CHN2. which covalently binds to the active-site cysteine of cathepsins B and 1. both in ritro and in live cells, but does not react with the inactive enzymes (Mason et al., 1989a.h). The enzymes in cells were labelled within 30 min (Mason et al., 1989a), which was considerably faster than the observed in- hibition of proteolysis produced by the diazomethanes in the study by Shaw & Dean (1980) It seemed possible therefore that diffusion could account for the uptake of diazomethanes.\nIn this paper we address this problem by looking at the ability of this inhibitor to enter intact purified lysosomes and therefore determine its ability to diffuse through the lipid bilayer directly. In order to determine the ability of Z-['\">IJiodo-Tyr-Ala-CHN, and other cysteine proteinase inhibitors to cross a lipid bilayer. we have looked at the ability of these inhibitors to enter itact isolated lysosomes and whole cells during culture.
