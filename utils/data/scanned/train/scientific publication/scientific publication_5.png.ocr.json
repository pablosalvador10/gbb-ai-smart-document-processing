Rix hester, Minnesota 55905\nRecen ed 13 December 1988 Accepted & March 1989\nMurine 3T3T stem cell transfocted with pSVIneo DNA were employed to study the effects of somatic cell differentiation on simian virus 40 IS\\ 40: T-antigen expression. This experimental approach was used because the 3T3T cell line is a well-characterized in vitro adipocyte differentiation system and the pS\\3neb plasmid contains the carly region of the S\\ 40 genome and a selective marker. G418 resistance. Cell clones containing stably Integrated pSVanen which expressed T antigen were Isolated in G418-containing medium. Most of these cell clones differentiated poorly. However. several ciones retained the ability to efficiently differentiate into adipocytes. and with these cell clones. it was established that adipocy te differentiation markedly repressed T-antigen expression. The differentiation-specific repression of T-antigen expression did not result from a loss of proliferative potential associated with terminal differentiation, because it was observed in adipocytes that could be restimulated to proliferate. In such cells. restimulation of cell growth induced reactivation of T-antigen expression. Repression of T-antigen expression was also demonstrated during differentiation of SV40 T-antigen-immortalized human keratinocytes. These results establish that the process of cellular differentiation can repress T-antigen expression in at least two distinct biological systems.\n1990 ANNUAL REPORT\nDuring the process of differentiation. numerous changes in cellular gene expression occur Since viral genes are depen. den on certain host factors for their expression. differenti. ution cun also affect the expression of vitaal genes. Fur example. in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells 114) and pluripotent mouse embryonic cells (44), the genes of several oncogenic varuses are expressed poorly or not at all. In contrast, proficient transcription occurs if the viral DNA is introduced into these cells after differentiation. This change in the ability of viral genes to be expressed is thought to involve the loss of diffusible repressor molecules during differentiation which were present previowish in the undif. ferentiated cells, These factors do not appear to be specific because a wide vaners of tumor viruses fail to replicate in undifferentiated embryon,il carcinoma cells in. 35. 371. and promoter or enhancer regions of smian virus 40 .5\\'4011.3h. polyomavirus (13. 311. murine leukemia virus +101. and adenovirus type 5 ELA 415) can each compete for these putative negathe regulatory factoresi. However. the biolog. ical events that occur when pluripotent embevonal cells differentiate are thought not to be representative of regula. tory processes involved in control of somit, cell different- atson. This conclusion is supported by obscisations the. there Is acine transcription of the S\\ 40 early region and other viral genes in undifferentiated somatic cells in culture 119. 241 In fact, the expression of some viral genes actually inhibits somalie differentiation in ventaan cells 14. 3X1\nTo determine if somatie cell differentiation can modulale 1-antagen expression. 312T cells were translected with PSV Inco DNA and selected los resistance to the antibiotic G418 Although 3331 cell normally differentiate ver effi- ciently into aupoestes, most p&Vinco-banstexted cell- dil- ferentiated very poorh Nevertheless, some vell ciones nere related which differentiated well One clone C'SV 2. 1. could in fact differentiate into adipogues at a frequency equal to that of the premal 2131 cell hne In ( SV =- 1 and 12 other\npSVAneo-transfected clonal cell lines. T-amigen expression was found to be markedly repressed during adipocy te differ. entiation, The repression of T antigen wus reversible when CSV3-1 adipocytes were stimulated to grow and was there. fore not a result of terminal differentiation. In addition, the repression of T antigen was evident during the differentiation of SV40 T-antigen-immortalized human keratinocytes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture. 3TAT murine mesenchymal stem cells were derived from BALB'e 3T3 clone A3] cells (7) and were cultured as previously described ( 16, 25. 421. Briefly. PTAT cells and pSVIneo-transfected derivative cell clones tree below i were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM contaming 10\"; fetal bovine serum (FBSI. Cultures were maintained at subconfluent cell densities and were mycoplasma-free. 'The HE-SV cell line. an SV40 T-antigen- Immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. was kindly pro- ved by P. M. Howley 121. HE-SV cells were cultured in serum-free MCDB 153 medium containing various cofactor and growth factors 4413.\nDNA transfection and isolation of cell clones expressing T antigen. Exponentially growing 3T3T cell cultures were transfected with pSV 3neo 1331 at 5 pg of DNA per 2.5 x 10' cell-, using a standard calcium phosphate technique 191. Cells with stable chromosomal integration of this plasmid were selected by culturing in medium containing 500 ug of (418 per ml for -4 weeks 15. 61. G418-resistant cells were placed in differentiation-inducing conditions described he- low, and after 7 days, single adipocytes and single undiffer. entiated cells were nolated from the same dishes and cloned by using the microchip method described previously (1-41. Clonal lines were developed from these individual cells by Inducing cell proliferation with DMEM containing 30G FBS and So ux of insulin per ml.\nThe HE-SV cell line was derived previously from human keratinoestes after transfection with plasmid DNA contain- ing the S'40 early region hy Banks-Schlegel and Howley (21.\n:\"1\nPUBLICATIONS\n034366\n10353760
