Duesberg Dept. of Molecular and Cell Biology, Stanley Hall, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA\nReceived 10 June 1994 Accepted 6 July 1994\nAbstract\nHemophilia-AIDS has been interpreted in terms of two hypotheses: the foreign-protein-AIDS hypothesis and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-AIDS hypothesis. The foreign-protein-AIDS hypothesis holds that proteins contaminating commercial clotting factor VIII cause immunosuppression. The foreign-protein hypothesis, but not the HIV hypothesis, correctly predicts seven characteristics of hemophilia-AIDS: 1) The increased life span of American hemophiliacs in the two decades before 1987, although 75% became infected by HIV - because factor VIII treatment, begun in the 1960s, extended their lives and simultaneously disseminated harmless HIV. After 1987 the life span of hemophiliacs appears to have decreased again, probably because of widespread treatment with the cytotoxic anti-HIV drug AZ.T. 2) The distinctly low, 1.3-2%, annual AIDS risk of hemophiliacs, compared to the higher 5-6% annual risk of intravenous drug users and male homosexual aphrodisiac drug users -- because transfusion of foreign proteins is less immunosuppressive than recreational drug use. 3) The age bias of hemophilia-AIDS, i.c. that the annual AIDS risk increased 2-fold for each 10-year increase in age - because immunosuppression is a function of the lifetime dose of foreign proteins received from transfusions. 4) The restriction of hemophilia-AIDS to immunodeficiency diseases - because foreign proteins cannot cause non- immunodeficiency AIDS diseases, like Kaposi's sarcoma. 5) The absence of AIDS diseases above their normal background in sexual partners of hemophiliacs - because transfusion-mediated immunotoxicity is not contagious. 6) The occurrence of immunodeficiency in HIV-free hemophiliacs - because foreign proteins, not HIV, suppress their immune system. 7) Stabilization, even regeneration, of immunity of HIV-positive hemophiliacs by long-term treatment with pure factor VIII. This shows that neither HIV nor factor VIII plus HIV are immunosuppressive by themselves. Therefore, AIDS cannot be prevented by elimination of HIV from the blood supply and cannot be rationally treated with genotoxic antiviral drugs, like AZT. Instead, hemophilia-AIDS can be prevented and has even been reverted by treatment with pure factor VIII.\n1. The drug- and hemophilia-AIDS epidemics in America and Europe\n- About 30 previously known diseases are now called AIDS if they occur in the presence of antibody against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Institute of Medicine, 1988; Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention, 1992). These diseases are thought to be conse- quences for an acquired immuno deficiency syndrome and hence are grouped together as AIDS (Institute of Medicine, 1988). From its beginning in 1981, AIDS has been restricted in America and Europe to specific risk groups (Centers for Disease Control, 1986; World Health Organization, 1992b). Currently, over 96% of\nall American AIDS cases come from AIDS risk groups, rather than from the general population (Centers for Disease Control, 1993). These include over 60% male homosexuals who have been long-term oral users of psychoactive and aphrodisiac drugs, 33% mostly het- erosexual, intravenous drug users and their children. 2% transfusion recipients, and about 1% hemophiliacs (Duesberg, 1992a; Centers for Disease Control, 1993). Altogether, about 90% of all American and European AIDS patients are males (World Health Organization, 1992a: Centers for Disease Control, 1993).\nEach risk group has specific AIDS diseases. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma is almost exclusively seen in male homosexuals, tuberculosis is common in intra-\n40024849\nAcks.

The foreign-protein-AIDS hypothesis holds that proteins contaminating commercial clotting factor VIII cause immunosuppression.

After 1987 the life span of hemophiliacs appears to have decreased again, probably because of widespread treatment with the cytotoxic anti-HIV drug AZ.T. 2) The distinctly low, 1.3-2%, annual AIDS risk of hemophiliacs, compared to the higher 5-6% annual risk of intravenous drug users and male homosexual aphrodisiac drug users -- because transfusion of foreign proteins is less immunosuppressive than recreational drug use. 3) The age bias of hemophilia-AIDS, i.c. that the annual AIDS risk increased 2-fold for each 10-year increase in age - because immunosuppression is a function of the lifetime dose of foreign proteins received from transfusions. 4) The restriction of hemophilia-AIDS to immunodeficiency diseases - because foreign proteins cannot cause non- immunodeficiency AIDS diseases, like Kaposi's sarcoma. 5) The absence of AIDS diseases above their normal background in sexual partners of hemophiliacs - because transfusion-mediated immunotoxicity is not contagious. 6) The occurrence of immunodeficiency in HIV-free hemophiliacs - because foreign proteins, not HIV, suppress their immune system. 7) Stabilization, even regeneration, of immunity of HIV-positive hemophiliacs by long-term treatment with pure factor VIII. This shows that neither HIV nor factor VIII plus HIV are immunosuppressive by themselves. Therefore, AIDS cannot be prevented by elimination of HIV from the blood supply and cannot be rationally treated with genotoxic antiviral drugs, like AZT.
