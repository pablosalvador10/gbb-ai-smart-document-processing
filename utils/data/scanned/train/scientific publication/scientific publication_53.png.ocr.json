We report here that two anti-SPAR monoclonal antibodies can modulate the secretory in- hibition caused by SP-A. A2C and A2R are rat mono- clonal antibodies raised independently and recognize a 32-kDa protein on rat alveolar type II cell mem- branes. Immunocytochemical studies show that these antibodies bind to isolated type II cells. Scatchard analysis confirms that SP-A binds alveolar type II cells through a single affinity receptor and shows that A2C and A2R recognize that same receptor. Both antibod- ies inhibit the binding of 125I-SP-A to isolated type II cells. The functional activity of this 32-kDa protein was studied by examining surfactant secretion in isolated type II cells. Surfactant phospholipid secretion was measured in cells that were exposed to various surfac- tant phospholipid secretagogues (ATP, dibutyryl CAMP, terbutaline, or ionomycin), ±SP-A (100 ng/ml), ±A2C or A2R. Both antibodies block the negative feed- back loop by which SP-A inhibits surfactant secretion. This activity of A2C and A2R is dose-dependent and is independent of the secretagogue used. Thus, the 32- kDa type II cell membrane protein bound by A2C and A2R is the functional receptor on alveolar type II cell membranes and regulates type II cell surfactant secre- tion.\nPulm\nExperimental Cell Research 226:90-97, 1996.\nOther support: National Institutes of Health.\nFrom the Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, and Department of

We report here that two anti-SPAR monoclonal antibodies can modulate the secretory in- hibition caused by SP-A. A2C and A2R are rat mono- clonal antibodies raised independently and recognize a 32-kDa protein on rat alveolar type II cell mem- branes. Immunocytochemical studies show that these antibodies bind to isolated type II cells. Scatchard analysis confirms that SP-A binds alveolar type II cells through a single affinity receptor and shows that A2C and A2R recognize that same receptor. Both antibod- ies inhibit the binding of 125I-SP-A to isolated type II cells. The functional activity of this 32-kDa protein was studied by examining surfactant secretion in isolated type II cells. Surfactant phospholipid secretion was measured in cells that were exposed to various surfac- tant phospholipid secretagogues (ATP, dibutyryl CAMP, terbutaline, or ionomycin), ±SP-A (100 ng/ml), ±A2C or A2R. Both antibodies block the negative feed- back loop by which SP-A inhibits surfactant secretion. This activity of A2C and A2R is dose-dependent and is independent of the secretagogue used. Thus, the 32- kDa type II cell membrane protein bound by A2C and A2R is the functional receptor on alveolar type II cell membranes and regulates type II cell surfactant secre- tion."},{"spans":[{"offset":1461,"length":4}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[617,719,700,683,720,728,637,764]}],"content":"Pulm"},{"spans":[{"offset":1466,"length":43}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[125,777,424,778,424,796,125,795]}],"content":"Experimental Cell Research 226:90-97, 1996."},{"spans":[{"offset":1510,"length":45}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[126,812,412,813,412,832,126,831]}],"content":"Other support: National Institutes of Health."},{"spans":[{"offset":1556,"length":160}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[124,847,670,852,670,889,124,884]}],"content":"From the Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, and Department of Pediatrics-Division of Neonatology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA."},{"spans":[{"offset":1717,"length":12}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[334,967,483,967,483,987,334,987]}],"role":"pageFooter","content":"PUBLICATIONS"},{"spans":[{"offset":1730,"length":7}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[664,968,750,968,750,987,664,987]}],"role":"pageFooter","content":"0054712"},{"spans":[{"offset":1738,"length":42}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[125,741,415,743,415,762,125,760]}],"content":"Strayer, D.S., Pinder, R., and Chander, A."}],"styles":[{"confidence":1,"spans":[{"offset":1461,"length":4}],"isHandwritten":true}],"contentFormat":"text","sections":[{"spans":[{"offset":0,"length":1716},{"offset":1738,"length":42}],"elements":["/paragraphs/0","/paragraphs/1","/paragraphs/2","/paragraphs/3","/paragraphs/4","/paragraphs/5","/paragraphs/6","/paragraphs/9"]}]}}
