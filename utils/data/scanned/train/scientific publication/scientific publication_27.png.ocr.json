The lung and liver DNA samples isolated from A/J mice treated with the various compounds were subjected to acid hydrolysis and the hydrolysates were analyzed for the presence of [5-'H]4-HPB. No detectable levels were found in the lung DNA isolated from [5-H]4-HPB-treated animals, whereas significant amounts of [5-H|4-HPB were released from lung and liver DNA isolated from [S'HJNNK- and [5>H]NNKOAc-treated mice. The levels of total binding and [5-311]4-HPB released from the globin isolated from these animals showed a similar trend. That is, low binding levels were detected in the globin isolated from [5-3H]4-HPB- treated animals and significantly higher levels of binding were detected in the globin from the [5-3HJNNKOAc- and [5- HJNNK-treated animals. Comparable findings were ob- tained in the rat experiments. These studies clearly demon- strate that methyl hydroxylation of NNK leads to a species that is capable of reacting covalently with nucleophiles in DNA and protein. Thus, the levels of 4-HPB released from DNA and globin can be attributed to the activation of NNK and not to the direct binding of 4-HPB.\nIntroduction\nThe tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK*) is a potent carcinogen in laboratory animals (1,2). The observation of relatively high concentrations of this nitrosamine in tobacco products (3) has led to the proposal that NNK plays a role in tobacco-related cancers in humans. NNK is bioactivated to several reactive species capable of binding to hemoglobin and DNA (4,5). One possible activation pathway involves hydroxylation of the methyl group to yield 4-(hydroxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1- butanone. This metabolite is believed to decompose to 4-oxo-4- (3-pyridyl)-1-butanediazohydroxide upon the release of form- aldchyde (Figure 1). This diazohydroxide can either react with water to produce 4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (4-HPB) or alkylate cellular nucleophiles in proteins and DNA as demon- strated by the incorporation of tritium into DNA and hemoglobin\n\"Abbreviations: NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, 4-HPB, 4-hydroxy-I-(3-pyridyl)-|-butanone; NNN, NÂº-zatrosonornicotine; NNKOAc, 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; myosmine. 3-(3,4- dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yi)pyridane; 3-HPB, 3-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-I-butanone; AcPB. 4-acetoxy-I-(3-pyndyl)-t-butanoee; NNAL, 4-(methylnitrosammno)-1- (3-pyridy!)-f-butanol.\nOxford University Press\n1329\nisolated from rats treated with pyridyl-tritiated NNK ([5-3H]- NNK) (4.5). The chemical nature of these adducts is unknown. In the case of DNA, the adducts are unstable and >50% of the bound radioactivity is released as labeled 4-HPB upon neutral thermal or acid hydrolysis of the DNA (5). Some of the globin adducts are also unstable and decompose to 4-HPB upon base treatment. These unstable adducts account for 15-40% of the radioactivity bound to the globin (4,6). These same adducts are also observed in animals treated with N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), another tobacco-specific nitrosamine (4,5).\nThese studies demonstrate that a-hydroxylation of NNK generates a reactive species capable of interacting covalently with cellular nucleophiles. Based on this proposal, a dosimetry assay was developed to measure the levels of 4-HPB released from hemoglobin of tobacco users (7). This assay assesses human exposure levels to NNK and NNN and an individual's ability to activate these carcinogens. However, 4-HPB is a metabolite of NNK and NNN (8) and may also be present in tobacco products. It is possible that 4-HPB itself interacts with DNA and hemoglobin in a reaction that is reversible under the hydrolysis conditions. In order to determine whether 4-HPB released from hemoglobin and DNA is derived from an adduct(s) formed via NNK activation or resulted from direct binding of 4-HPB to these macromolecules, we measured the levels of 4-HPB released from DNA and hemoglobin isolated from rodents treated with [5-3H]- NNK, [5->H]4-HPB, or [5-3H]4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNKOAc), the acetylated hydroxymethyl metabolite of NNK. This last compound will generate the reactive pyridyloxobutylating agent in situ upon esterase hydrolysis\nNNXOAG\nM-0\nA esterase\nN.M.OH\n2502237008\n+ HCH0\nH+ ar OH\"\nONA and glebin adducts\nFig. 1.
