FELDMAN, PIERCE, GLENN, SCIENTIFIC STAFF\nINTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM\nTO:\nDavid Stone PhD\nFROM: DATE: SUBJECT:\nHenry T. Lynch MD Application #2986, \"Tumor Suppression Genes in Human Hematologic 7/13/90 Malignancy and Transgenic Mice,\" Prabhat K. Ghosh PhD\nSecondary Reviewer\nThe PI wishes to elucidate mechanisms by which hematologic malignancies develop, with particular attention to tumor suppressor genes, and their role in human malignancy. He believes that tumor suppressor gene inactivation may be involved in certain cases of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and polycythemia vera (P. vera), lesions which involve nonlymphoid hematopoietic elements. It is noted that the retinoblastoma (Rb) deletion within chromosome 13q occurs with frequencies of 10-20% in both AMM and P. vera and that p53 inactivation causes the conversion to blast crises in the majority of CML patients.\nThe PI presented data that showed oncogenic proteins of simian virus 40 (SV40), adenoviruses 2 and 5, and papillomaviruses bind both Rb and p53 proteins, and that they may induce malignancy by inactivating these proteins. Transgenic mice harboring the SV40 T-antigen gene develop retinoblastomas wherein the Rb protein is bound to T Ag. The PI has spent almost 15 years studying the organization and expression of the SV40 gene, including the gene for T Ag and he believes that this may now provide new insights into the role of tumor suppressor genes in malignancy.\nHis aims will be to investigate the possibility that deletion or inactivation of the Rb gene may be involved in certain hematologic disorders of man, particularly AMM and P. vera, and to demonstrate links between Rb gene inactivation, and then to attempt to induce myeloprolifera- tive or myeloleukemic disorder in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells harboring transduced antisense Rb sequences. He will also study a variety of other lesions, including thymomas, choroid plexus tumors, and polycystic kidney disease with renal carcinomas in transgenic mice carrying the SV40 T Ag gene, and assess the possibility of binding and inactivation of Rb and/or p53 proteins by T Ag.\nIn his section on supporting data, using the Southern study, he suggests that homozygous Rb deletion has occurred in a patient's disease cells who had manifested AMM. He is currently performing additional studies on this patient, including an attempt at finding hybridization of Rb to both chromosomes 13 in lymphocytes but lacking hybridization of Rb in granulocytes. He states this would indicate homozygous Rb deletion in the patient's disease cells. This would indicate heterozygous deletion. He suggests that the diseased WBCs in his patient with AMM have sustained homozygous deletion of Rb cells and, should this be borne out by additional studies, it would suggest that myeloid lineage cells require functional Rb protein for normal control of proliferation and differentiation, and that homozygous Rb deletion may be a factor involved in the genesis of certain cases of AMM. If this were the case, it would be an extremely crucial observation for hematology and would show further the role of Rb inactivation. He mentions his awareness of some 20 patients of Dr. Jer Wang of Downstate Medical Center in New York City who have had cytogenetic studies and whose peripheral WBCs and WBC DNAs have been stored. In one of these patients, a deletion of chromosome 13 was observed. He expects additional patients to be so identified in that 10-20% of AMM patients have chromosome 13q deletions. This is extremely interesting.\nThe methods appear to be well-written and the PI's extensive experience with the mouse model is crucial to this study.\nThis is a timely study and if the methods are sound, and Dr. Knudson will be in the best position to comment on this matter, then I would rank this proposal as being high in merit (A) and, of course, in relevance (A).\nHTL:dks\nCTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O.
