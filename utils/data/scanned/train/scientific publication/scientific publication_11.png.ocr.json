To identify components acting downstream of let-60 ras in the vulval signaling pathway, we have identified a reduction-of-function mutation in the sur-1 gene that completely suppresses the multivulva phenotype of a hyperactive let-60 ras mutation. About 10% of animals homozygous for the sur-1 motation also display a specific and intriguing vulval cell lineage defect. In addition, the sur-1 mutation results in a cold-sensitive egg-laying defective phenotype and a partial larval lethal phenotype. We have cloned the sur-I gene by DNA-mediated transformation and have shown that it encodes a protein similar in overall structure to mammalian MAP kinases (ERKs). The functional homology between Sur-1 MAP kinase and mammalian MAP kinases was also demonstrated by the ability of a rat ERK2 kinase to rescue the sur-1 mutant phenotypes. Genetic double-mutant analyses place sur-1 downstream of let-60 ras but upstream of lin-1 in the vulval signaling pathway. Our results provide further evidence for the extreme conservation of Ras-mediated signaling pathway between worms and humans and for the function of MAP kinases in cell signaling processes that control cell differentiation and animal development.\n[Key Words: MAP kinase; sur-1; ras; C. elegans; vulval development; signal transduction] Received November 2, 1993; revised version accepted December 8, 1993.\nDevelopment of the hermaphrodite vulva in the nema- tode Caenorhabditis elegans is initiated by intercellular signaling (for review, see Horvitz and Sternberg 1991]. Prior to vulval induction, a set of six ectodermal precur- sor cells (P3.p-P8.p) have the same developmental po- tential. According to the current model, the combination of an inhibitory signal from the epidermis and an induc- tive signal from the gonadal anchor cell induces three of the six precursor cells |P5.p-P7.p) to generate vulval tis- sue. The other three cells [P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p) generate nonspecific epidermis (Fig. 1A). Genetic and molecular studies have defined roles for several cell signaling pro- teins in vulval induction (see Fig. 6, below]. For example, the let.60 gene encodes a Ras protein that acts down- stream of let-23 (receptor tyrosine kinase) and sem-5 (a protein with SH2 and SH3 domains) to control vulval cell fates (Aroian et al. 1990) Han and Sternberg 1990; Clark et al. 1992). Loss-of-function mutations in let-60 ras result in fewer than three vulval precursor cells (VPCs] to generate vulval cells [vulvaless or Vul],\nwhereas gain-of-function (gf) let-60 ras mutations result in more than three VPCs to generate vulval cells (mul- tivulva or Muv) (Beitel et al. 1990; Han et al. 1990). The lin-45 gene, which encodes a homolog of the mammalian Raf kinases, appears to act after let-60 ras but upstream of lin-1 in the signaling pathway (Han et al. 1993].\nWell-established genetics in C. elegans provided us with an opportunity to identify new components in the Ras-mediated cell signaling pathway and to analyze their role in developmental pattern formation. Here, we report a genetic and molecular analysis of the sur-1 gene. The genetic analysis of a mutation in the sur-1 gene suggests that it is likely to act downstream of the let-60 zas gene to affect the vulval signaling process. The molecular analysis of the sur-1 gene demonstrates that it encodes a protein structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian p42 MAP kinases. Our present results pro- vide in vivo evidence for the function of MAP kinases in receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras-mediated cell signaling processes that control cell differentiation and prolifera- tion. Similar and complementary results on the same C. elegans MAP kinase gene have been obtained indepen- dently by Lackner et al. (this issue).\n\"Corresponding author.\nGENES & DEVELOPMENT 8:147-159 0 1994 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/94 $5.00\n147\nPUBLICATIONS
