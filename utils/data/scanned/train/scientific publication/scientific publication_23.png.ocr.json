B. Cohen\nLocalization of cAMP in dog and cat trachea: effects of ß-adrenergic agonists\nSTEPHEN C. LAZARUS. CAROL B. BASBAUM, AND WARREN M.

Localization of CAMP in dog and cat trachea: effects of B-adrenergie agonists. Am. J. Physiol. 247 (Cell Physiol. 16): C327-C334. 1984, -Adenosine 3'.5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is believed to mediate the transport of ions, water, and mucous glycoproteins in the respiratory tract. Because chemical measurements of total tissue levels of CAMP may not always reflect changes in specific cell types, we adapted standard immunocytochemical methods to examine the cellular localiza- tion of CAMP in dog and cat tracheae. The d adrenergic ago- niste terbutaline and isoproterenol increased immunoreactive CAMP in ciliated epithelial cells of dog and cat trachese and in both serous and mucous gland cells of cat tracheae. Epithelial goblet cells did not respond to d-adrenergic agonists in either species. This study provides information about the location of A-receptors on individual cells in the trachea that is not avail- able from chemical assays of either cAMP or 8-receptors in these tissues. Our results support the hypothesis that secretory functions in both serous and mucous submucosal gland cells and ciliated epithelial cells, but not goblet cells. may involve cyclic AMP-dependent mechanisms.\nion transport; mucus secretion; receptor; ciliated epithelial cell; goblet cell: submucosal gland; immunocytochemistry\nSECRETIONS from the tracheobronchial tree are a com- plex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, electrolytes, and water. They originate in part from the airway epithelium and in part from submucosal glands. The relative contri- butions from these two sites and the factors which mod- ulate secretion are only partly understood and vary among species. Adrenergic agonists have been shown to increase transport of radiolabeled glycoproteins across the tracheal wall (6. 14, 15, 20, 23) and to stimulate chloride and sodium transport in the trachea (2, 12, 23). It has been postulated that some of the effects of adre. nergic agonists are mediated by the adenylate cyclase- CAMP system, and several studies have examined the relationship between stimulation of ion or glycoprotein transport and levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophos- phate (cAMP) assayed in tissue homogenates (1, 3, 20, 26). However, because the trachea is a heterogeneous tissue, with up to 11 distinct cell types described in the epithelium alone, these studies require the assumption of parallel changes of cAMP content within specific cell pes (e.g., ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, and cells .n submucosal glands) and in the tissue as a whole. Studies in heterogeneous tissue (25) as well as in isolated 0363-6143/84 $1.50 Copyright &> 1984 the American Physiological Society\ncells (8) suggest the possibility that total tissue levels may not always reflect changes within specific cell types. The development of immunocytochemical techniques for identification of cAMP has allowed localization of cAMP to specific cells and even to sites within cells (29).\nIn this study we have used immunocytochemistry to localize CAMP in cells of the trachea and to study differ- ences between resting cells and those stimulated by 8- adrenergic agonists. Terbutaline and isoproterenol in- creased immunoreactive CAMP in ciliated and basal ep- ithelial cells of dog and cat tracheae and in serous and mucous gland cells of cat tracheae. Epithelial goblet cella did not respond to @-adrenergic agonists in either species. This study is the first to show changes in cAMP in specific cell types of the trachea in response to stimula- tion by 8-adrenergic agonists and confirms that changes in CAMP measured chemically in whole tissue do not reflect parallel changes within all cells. This use of a probe for detection of the presence of adenylate cyclase- coupled receptors in specific cell types permits identifi- cation of cells in which CAMP increases in response to a variety of pharmacological manipulations and naturally occurring phenomena.\nMETHODS\nIn these experiments we adhered to the published guidelines of the American Physiological Society for the care and use of laboratory animals, and the specific protocols were approved by the Animal Research Com- mittee of the University of California, San Francisco.\nAntiserum\nBy use of the method of Spruill and Steiner (29), 2'. O-monosuccinyl-cAMP (Sigma) was conjugated to a car- rier protein, human serum albumin Fraction V (US Bio- chemical). New Zealand White rabbits (2.5-3.5 kg) were immunized by injecting a mixture of the antigen-protein conjugate (1 mg), Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories: 1 ml) and 0.9% saline (1 ml) subcutane- ously. Booster immunizations prepared with Freund's incomplete adjuvant were administered at 4- to 6-wk intervals. Blood samples were obtained from eachanimal before the primary immunization (preimmune serum) and 7-10 days after each booster immunization. The serum immunoglobulins were partially purified by frac- tionation with 40% ammonium sulfate.

Terbutaline and isoproterenol in- creased immunoreactive CAMP in ciliated and basal ep- ithelial cells of dog and cat tracheae and in serous and mucous gland cells of cat tracheae. Epithelial goblet cella did not respond to @-adrenergic agonists in either species. This study is the first to show changes in cAMP in specific cell types of the trachea in response to stimula- tion by 8-adrenergic agonists and confirms that changes in CAMP measured chemically in whole tissue do not reflect parallel changes within all cells. This use of a probe for detection of the presence of adenylate cyclase- coupled receptors in specific cell types permits identifi- cation of cells in which CAMP increases in response to a variety of pharmacological manipulations and naturally occurring phenomena."},{"spans":[{"offset":4299,"length":7}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[409,571,462,571,462,583,409,583]}],"role":"sectionHeading","content":"METHODS"},{"spans":[{"offset":4307,"length":265}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[409,588,707,590,707,650,409,648]}],"content":"In these experiments we adhered to the published guidelines of the American Physiological Society for the care and use of laboratory animals, and the specific protocols were approved by the Animal Research Com- mittee of the University of California, San Francisco."},{"spans":[{"offset":4573,"length":9}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[409,659,464,659,464,671,409,671]}],"content":"Antiserum"},{"spans":[{"offset":4583,"length":750}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[407,667,707,677,701,853,401,843]}],"content":"By use of the method of Spruill and Steiner (29), 2'.

Booster immunizations prepared with Freund's incomplete adjuvant were administered at 4- to 6-wk intervals.
