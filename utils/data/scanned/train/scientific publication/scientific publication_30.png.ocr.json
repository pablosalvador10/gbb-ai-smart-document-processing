It is of the same order as that found in O, and CO,, and it is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that analogous effects are important in all these molecules. Further, the most simple-minded approach to electron-electron repulsion surely in- dicates that configurations which have high prob- ability according to (XII) must, in truth, have a considerable probability relative to those indicated by the Kekule formule. Yet, resonance between the two Kekule forms sets a low probability on such configurations which separate spatially all the six electrons of the 'aromatic sextet' but nevertheless locate all in bond regions.\nThese ideas can be extended to other aromatic systems, chemical reactions, other free radicals, certain molecular compounds, all other systems which are usually represented in terms of resonance, and complex ions ; and these and other applications will be presented elsewhere. Here the account given has been qualitative, but wave-functions can be devised which correspond to the above structures and hence\nquantitative and semi-quantitative developments are possible. The method would be an extension of the valence-bond method. However, the wave functions could not be of the Heitler-London type but some modified or new form would have to be developed. This should not be difficult.\nThe proposal submitted here may be summarized in the following way. G. N. Lewis' stressed the import- ance of the electron octet. In all cases he treated it as made up of four pairs. It is suggested here that it is better to treat it as two groups of four electrons. When the two groups of four are similarly disposed, as they are in many molecules, the descriptions as four-pairs or two-quartets become identical. How- over, in other molecules and radicals, the employment of the two-quartets concept provides a satisfactory description, whereas the Lewis four-pairs does not. Therefore, it is proposed that the octet should not be treated primarily as four pairs but rather as a double-quartet.\nLinnett, J. W., J. Chem. Soc., 275 (1956). Green, M., and Linnett, J. W., J.

It is not known whether there is any relationship between the chromosome number and the radiosensitivity of tumour cells. Work on the relationship between ploidy and sensitivity to radia- tion has been carried out on cells falling into the euploid series and derived from such biological objects as plants, fungi and arthropods\". If the effect of radiation on cell multiplication alone is considered, all reported observations indicate that radiosensitivity is greatest in the haploid cell and decreases more or less regularly with increasing ploidy. No direct extrapolations to neoplastic cells are permissible, . however, since the predominant stem-line cell type is aneuploid in many tumours. The main stem-line number is frequently doubled, more or less exactly, in a smaller, second stem-line1. It cannot be predicted how a given ancuploid stem-line will react to radia- tion as compared to the doubled stem-line. Re- arrangements occurring concurrently with, or after, duplication may, for example, render sensitive sites monosomic and make the cell more sensitive to radiation.\nThe problem was approached experimentally by determining the radiosensitivity of selected sub-lines of different ploidy derived from the same original tumour. In such material the findings can be inter- preted with more confidence than would be the case when comparing independent tumour cell populations of different ploidy which, besides possible differences in radiosensitivity, may differ with regard to many,\nnot necessarily relevant, other characteristics. An Ehrlich ascites tumour, designated ELD, also known under the synonym Landschutz sarcoma I or under the designation LE was used4-4. This tumour and its sub-lines were maintained in adult, heterozygous mice by intraperitoneal transfer of 0.1 ml. ascites diluted tenfold with sterile Ringer solution. During several periods of varying length, the cells were stored at -79º C. Chromosomes were counted on aceto-orcein squash preparations of material treated with colchicin7. More than 95 per cent of the ELD population is hyperdiploid with a modal chromosome number of 46. Cells with a doubled, hypertetraploid number occur at frequencies between 1 and 5 per cent.\nFollowing Kaziwara's approach of 'immunoselec- tion', that is, taking advantage of the increased\nTable 1.

When the two groups of four are similarly disposed, as they are in many molecules, the descriptions as four-pairs or two-quartets become identical. How- over, in other molecules and radicals, the employment of the two-quartets concept provides a satisfactory description, whereas the Lewis four-pairs does not.
