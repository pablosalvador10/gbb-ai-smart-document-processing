Wynder\nNaylor Dana Institute for Disease Prevention, American Health Foundation, Valhalla, NY, USA\nEpidemiological studies have shown that the long-term smoker of low-yield cigarettes has a 20-50% lower risk of lung cancer than the smoker of high-yield cigarettes. This risk reduction is attributed to changes in the make-up of cigarettes and especially to the introduction of filter tips. Other changes relate to the use of tobaccos that produce lower smoke yields, including reconstituted and expanded tobaccos, as well as utilization of porous cigarette paper and perforated filter tips. New developments in the make-up of commercial cigarettes must be monitored in order to prevent unfavourable introductions. Although a smoke-free society should be the major public health goal, recent consumer statistics do not support this goal. Thus, a strong social case is made for further developments in the low-yield cigarette.\nIn 1961, Wynder and Day offered three postulates for the causation of noncommunicable diseases, including cancer:\n(1) The greater and the more prolonged the exposure to the factor, the greater the risk of a population involved.\n(2) The epidemiological pattern should be consistent with the distribution of the factor.\n(3) Removal or reduction of the risk factors for a given population group should be followed by a reduction in the incidence of disease.\nMore than 100 epidemiological studies from various countries have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the risk for cancer of the lung (IARC, 1986; US Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). Laboratory studies have substantiated these findings by documenting the dose-response relationship between exposure to cigarette smoke and tumours of the upper respiratory tract in hamsters (Dontenwill, 1974) and that between application of smoke condensate to the skin of mice and rabbits and tumour yield at the site of application (Wynder & Hoffmann, 1967). These findings clearly satisfy postulate (1) for a causative association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.\nPostulate (2) is sustained by the correlation between age at onset of cigarette smoking and depth of inhalation with risk for lung cancer. Further support is gleaned from the observation that, by comparison to cigarette smokers, primary cigar and pipe smokers have\n99043168\n-449- :selected: :unselected: :unselected:
