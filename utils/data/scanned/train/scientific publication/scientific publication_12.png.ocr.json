August 20, 1990\nABSTRACT Diabetes and aging are commonly accompa- nled by arterio- and atherosclerosis. Infiltration of the arterial subendothelial Intima by macrophages/monocytes is no im- portant early event preceding the development of atheromatous lesions: these macrophages are known to produce mitogenic factors in early atherosclerotic lesions. It has been previously shown that, over time, vascular matrix accumulates proteins nonenzymatically modified by advanced glycosylation end products (AGEst. In view of the fact that macrophages/ munocyits have AGE-specific receptors associated with the expression of several growth factors, we Investigated the pos- sibility that AGEs medinte Initial monocyte-vessel wall Inter- actions that occur before overt formation of vascular lesions. This study demonstrates that ti in vitro- and in vivo-formed AGEs are chemotactic for human blood monocytes. (if) sub- endothelial AGEs can selectively induce monocyte migration across an intact endothelial cell monolayer, and (iii) subsequent monocyte Interaction with AGE-containing matrix results in the expression of platelet-derived growth factor. These results support the existing hypothesis that in vivo-forming glucose- derived protein adducts can act as signals for the normal turnover of senescent tissue protein by means of the AGE- specific receptor system. Time-dependent glucose-Induced dep- osition of AGEs on matrix proteins may, promote monocyte Infiltration into the subendothellum. Subsequent AGE-trig- gered macrophage activation and consequent elaboration of proliferative factors muy normally coordinate remodeling but may also lead to the diverse pathogenic changes typical of arterio- and atherosclerosis In diabetic or aging populations.\nProteins exposed to ambient glucose undergo nonenzymatic glycosylation. leading to the progressive formation of highly reactive late addition products termed advanced glycosyia- tion end products (AGEs).

Monocytes/ macrophages express AGE-specific receptors that mediate endocytosis and degradation of AGE-modified proteins (7). After AGE binding and intracellular processing. monocytes synthesize and secrete growth-promoting cytokines such as cacheclin/tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1. and insulin-\nThe publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared by incu- bating BSA (fraction V. low endotoxin: Bochringer Mann- heimlin phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 50 mM glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) as described 47). Normal control BSA was incubated under the same conditions without Glc-6-P. Fluorescence spectra of AGE-BSA tat 460 nm upon excita. tion at 390 nm) indicated increased glycosylation as a func- tion of time (see Results). At 42 days AGE-BSA contained 80 arbitrary fluorescence units (AFL' per 100 ug of protein). whereas unmodified BSA maintained background levels (4 AFU per 100 ug of protein). For selected experiments samples (20 mg each) incubated with 50 mM Glc-6-P for 3 and 6 days were reduced with sodium borohydride as described (10).\nPreparation of AGE-Modified Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). LDL was prepared from pooled normolipidemic human serum by density-gradient ultracentrifugation (11). LDL was glycosylated in vitro (AGE-LDL) as described above for 3 weeks in the presence of the antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene (20 uMI and EDTA (0.5 mM) and under a blanket of N2 in scaled tubes. Oxidized LDL was prepared by incubating LDL for 3 weeks in the absence of antioxidants or glucose. The amount of lipid peroxidation was estimated as thiobarbituric acid-reactive material (12). and the extent of advanced nonenzy matic glycosylation of the LDL samples was determined by fluorescence as de- scribed above. AGE-modified LDL exhibited three times greater fluorescence (30 AFU per 100 ug of protein) than unmodified LDL 19 AFU per 100 as of proteinl.\nPreparation of Peripheral Nerve Myelin. Human peripheral nerve myelin obtained at autopsy from a 5-month-old normal infant. a 63-year-old nondiabetic. and a 61-year-old diabetic was isolated by standard procedures (13). Fluorescence studies of the myelin from the 61-year-old diabetic indicated J-fold greater AGE-levels (156 AFU per 100 ug of protein) than the age-matched normal individual 150 AFU per 100 ps of protein). which produced 3.5-fold greater fluorescence\nAbbreviations: AGEs. advanced glycosylation end products: FMLP.
