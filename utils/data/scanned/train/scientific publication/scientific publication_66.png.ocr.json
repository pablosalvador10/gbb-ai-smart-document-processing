To provide a cytogenetic marker for nuclear transplantation experiments, triploid Rana pipiens embryos were produced. These embryos were injected with Lucke tumor herpesvirus. The chromosome profile of a renal carcinoma that developed in one of these triploid embryos was compared to the chromosomal profiles of a naturally occurring diploid renal carcinoma and a diploid renal tumor maintained as serial ante- rior eye chamber allografts for over 7 yr. Examination of Ag- NOR-stained chromosome spreads from the putative triploid and naturally occurring putative diploid tumor revealed the expected results. The vast majority of the chromosome spreads,\n54/57 (95%) and 6/7 (86%), respectively, displayed euploid chromosome and Ag-NOR profiles: 3N = 39 with three Ag- NORs at the secondary constrictions in the long arm of chro- mosome 10 (10q) and 2N - 26 with two Ag-NORs in 10q. Chromosome profiles from the long-term allografted tumor were highly aneuploid (82%) and, based on their Ag-NOR con- tent, displayed variations in their 2N, 3N, and 4N numbers. These data indicate that the majority of recently transformed triploid Luck√© tumor cells can provide donor nuclei suitable for the characterization of developmental potential.\nNuclear transplantation in vertebrates was initially devel- oped in the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens (Briggs and King, 1952). Because gynogenesis is possible in frogs, great care must be taken to provide evidence that animals produced in nuclear transplantation experiments develop from the genetic instructions of the inserted nucleus and not from those of inad- vertently retained egg chromosomes. One way to provide such evidence is to use donor nuclei of a chroi. psomal constitution that would be unlikely to occur in the recipient ovum without a transplanted nucleus. Detection of a cytogenetic marker in the nuclear transplant larva or frog would then provide evidence that the nuclear transplantation experiment is valid, i.e., that the development is due solely to the transplanted nucleus (McKinnell, 1978).\nStable chromosome markers have not been described in R. pipiens. While pigment-pattern polymorphisms exist (McKin- nell and Dapkus, 1973), they do not lend themselves to use as markers in nuclear transplant studies that are terminated experimentally or naturally before the larvae metamorphose into adult frogs. Fortunately, a stable cytogenetic marker is eas- ily fabricated. This marker is triploidy, produced by subjecting freshly fertilized eggs to hydrostatic pressure, which suppresses production of the second polar body.\nTriploidy is compatible with normal development in R. pipiens. The triploid larvae undergo metamorphosis at about the same time as their diploid counterparts and presumably have a similar life expectancy (Briggs, 1947). An improperly enucleated egg would be expected to be either haploid (having the chromosomes of the mature egg) or diploid (the chromo- some number of the secondary oocyte). Triploidy in the result- ing nuclear transplant animals argues forcefully that the organ- ism developed under the genetic control of the donor nucleus and not from the genetic instructions of a maternal nucleus in an inappropriately enucleated oocyte or egg. Triploidy has been used as a cytogenetic marker in nuclear transfer experiments (Gallien et al., 1963; McKinnell et al., 1969; DiBerardino et al., 1986; Orr et al., 1986; DiBerardino and Hoffner-Ort, 1992).\nIn this communication, we present the first description of the cytogenetics of a triploid Lucke carcinoma produced for use\nPUBLICATIONS 044016\n11050506\nSupported by National Institutes of Health (NIHYMBRS grant SO6GM080901 and NIH/RCMI grant G12RR03059-0IAI (J.W.W. and C.S.W.). grant 2675 from the Council for Tobacco Research-USA, Inc.
