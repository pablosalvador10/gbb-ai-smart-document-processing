Taft, Su Y. Ling and T. Daniel Griffiths Department of Biological Sciences and Plant Molecular Biology Center, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL. 601 15 (U.S.A.) (Received 23 January 1991) (Revision received 13 May 1991) (Accepted 15 May 1991)\nKeywords: DNA repair: DNA replication; SCE induction; CHO cells; UV; Thymidine incorporation\nSummary\nThe relative importance of the UV-induced pyrimidine(5-6)pyrimidine and the pyrimidine(6-4)- pyrimidone lesions in sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs), activation of alternative sites of replicon initiation and thymidine incorporation were examined using wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) AA8 cells which remove both lesions, mutant CHO UV61 cells which remove only the (6-4) lesion and mutant CHO UVS cells which remove neither lesion. Our data suggest that both lesions play a role in each end point examined. The relative importance of these lesions is dependent on the end point studied as well as the fluence used. For SCE induction and the activation of alternative sites of replicon initiation, the (6-4) lesion appears to play a predominant role, while for the thymidine incorporation studies the (6-4) lesion appears to play the predominant role at low fluences while the role of the (5-6) lesion increases at higher fluences.\nThere has been much debate concerning the relative roles of the two predominant UV-in- duced lesions, the pyrimidine(5-6)pyrimidine or (5-6) lesion, and the pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidonc or (6-4) lesion, in cytotoxicity, inhibition of DNA synthesis and mutation induction. Work per- formed with A phage indicates that the (5-6) dimer can be lethal but it is not the principal\nCorrespondence: Dr. T.

By using Es- cherichia coli photolyase in the presence of visible light, Wood was able to show that removal of the (5-6) dimer resulted in little change in the muta- tion frequency of the Ã€ phage, but did increase the ability to form plaques.\nIn E. coli, enzymatic photoreactivation (EPR) has been used to remove the (5-6) dimer and to observe the effect of this action on cell survival and mutagenesis. Brash et al. (1985) found that the (5-6) dimer is the principal cytotoxic lesion. They also determined that the (6-4) lesion is most likely the pre-mutagenic lesion. The (5-6) dimer appeared to correlate to mutation

Our data suggest that both lesions play a role in each end point examined. The relative importance of these lesions is dependent on the end point studied as well as the fluence used. For SCE induction and the activation of alternative sites of replicon initiation, the (6-4) lesion appears to play a predominant role, while for the thymidine incorporation studies the (6-4) lesion appears to play the predominant role at low fluences while the role of the (5-6) lesion increases at higher fluences."},{"spans":[{"offset":1635,"length":371}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[109,616,373,617,373,736,109,735]}],"content":"There has been much debate concerning the relative roles of the two predominant UV-in- duced lesions, the pyrimidine(5-6)pyrimidine or (5-6) lesion, and the pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidonc or (6-4) lesion, in cytotoxicity, inhibition of DNA synthesis and mutation induction.
