Aldote reductase gene expression and osmotic dysregulation in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cella. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (En- docrinol Metab. 28): E428-E438, 1993 .- A \"compatible os- molyta hypothesis\" proposes that intracellular nonionic organic osmolytes such as sorbitol, myo-inositol, taurine, betaine, and dyerrophosphoryicholine respond coordinately to changes in external osmolality, thereby maintaining the intracellular ionic milieu. Osmoregulation may be the primary physiological func- tion of aldose reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of glu- come to sorbitol. Glucose-induced sorbitol accumulation in isos- motic byperglycemic states is associated with compensatory depletion of myo-inositol and taurine. Because such depletion may predispone to chronic diabetic complications, the relation- chip between osmolyte shifts and aldose reductase gene expres- sion was studied in two human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines, one exhibiting osmoregulated and the other high basel aldose reductase gene expression. High basal expression of the aldose reductase pene was associated with rapid sorbitol accu- mulation and myo-inositol depletion in response to hypergly- camic (20 mM) concentrations of glucose. Myo-inositol and sorbitol bebaved as compensating intracellular osmolytes by accumulating markedly in response to hyperosmolality (300 mM mannitol). Thus the pattern of response of myo-inositol to hyperglycemic and hyperosmotic levels of glucose and mannitol was related to the degree of basal aidone reductase gane expres- sion, which may therefore influence the development of diabetic complications.\ndiabetic complications: osmoregulation; myo-inositol; sorbitol\nFOR OVER 20 years, stimulation of aldose reductase (AR2; EC 1.1.1.21) activity by mass action has been viewed as a critical link between hyperglycemia and the tissue damage underlying some chronic diabetic compli- cations (11, 16, 20). However, the modulatory role of AR2 gene expression in this process has not been ezten- sively explored (11, 18, 20, 36). Indeed, the view that AR2 is an important physiological intracellular osmo- regulator in the renal medalla, where it is strongly and specifically induced by extracellular hyperosmolality, has only recently emerged as part of a \"compatible os- molyte\" hypothesis (25). This hypothesis argues that nonionic [and therefore, \"nomperturbing\" (38)] com- pounds such as sorbitol, myo-inositol (MI), betaine, tau- Recently, stable lines of cultured human retinal pig- ment epithelial cells (RPE) have emerged as useful in vitro models for the study of some biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (9, 19, 27). Two RPE cell lines that exhibit quantitative and qual- itative differences in AR2 gene regulation (19) and dia- metrically opposite effects of pathophysiological hyper- glycemia on phosphoinositide signal transduction (21, 33) have recently been described. These cell lines were rine, and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) function as alternative organic intracellular osmolytes responding coordinately to changes in external osmolality, thereby buffering otherwise injurious shifts in the intracellular electrolyte and water composition (5, 38). Osmolar stress produces a compensatory increase or decrease in the intracellular concentration of one or more of these alternative osmolytes by induction or suppression of the relevant synthetic or degradative enzymes [AR2 in the employed to examine the effects of AR2 gane regulation case of sorbitol (2) and GPC diesterase in the case of on the osmoregulatory response to hyperglycemic and\n0183-1849/93 32.00 Copyright @ 1993 the American Physiological Society\ntaurine, and betaine transporters; see Refs. 24, 29, 35), thus accumulating or disposing (5) of these osmolytes in & coordinated fashion. The relative importance of these compounds in cell osmoregulation varies from tissue to tissue as follows: in renal tissus, betaine and GPC may have a critical role in opposing the damaging effects of urea on protein, wherees sorbitol and MI buffer intra- cellular sodium and potassium (2, 3, 5, 25); in neuronal tissues, taurine and MI may predominate in osmoregu- lation (15, 32).\nThese osmolytes would also appear to osmotically modulate intracellular electrolyte and water composi- tion under isosmolar conditions as well, since they are subject to fine feedback inhibition (4) and since they each reciprocally adjust to osmotically trivial shifts in other compatible osmolytes (5). For example, the accu- mulation of even micromolar concentrations of sorbitol through its synthesis from excess intracellular ghacose by AR2 during isosmotic hyperglycemia has been asso- ciated with reciprocal lowering of MI (13, 20, 21) and taurine (23, 34). Although initially regarded as metabol- ically inert, these organic osmolytes are now thought to have important metabolic and osmoregulatory roles (5, 20. 31). Thus, under certain circumstances, MI may modulate phosphoinositide signaling (27), and taurine may have a wide variety of intracellular functions (31). Abnormalities of both have been implicated in chronic diabetic complications (16, 23, 27, 33, 34). Given the proven osmoregulatory and metabolic importance of these organic osmolytes under isosmolar and hyperos- molar conditions, abnormal expression of the relevant genes might exaggerate the deleterious effects of other- wise trivial osmolar and/or metabolic stress, such as might occur in diabetes mellitus, thereby predisposing to the development of secondary complications. Indeed. provocative, fragmentary, but conflicting data suggest a possible association between increased AR2 enzymatic activity and/or protein and the presence of late diabetic complications (10, 18,

Aldote reductase gene expression and osmotic dysregulation in cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cella. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (En- docrinol Metab. 28): E428-E438, 1993 .- A \"compatible os- molyta hypothesis\" proposes that intracellular nonionic organic osmolytes such as sorbitol, myo-inositol, taurine, betaine, and dyerrophosphoryicholine respond coordinately to changes in external osmolality, thereby maintaining the intracellular ionic milieu. Osmoregulation may be the primary physiological func- tion of aldose reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of glu- come to sorbitol. Glucose-induced sorbitol accumulation in isos- motic byperglycemic states is associated with compensatory depletion of myo-inositol and taurine. Because such depletion may predispone to chronic diabetic complications, the relation- chip between osmolyte shifts and aldose reductase gene expres- sion was studied in two human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines, one exhibiting osmoregulated and the other high basel aldose reductase gene expression. High basal expression of the aldose reductase pene was associated with rapid sorbitol accu- mulation and myo-inositol depletion in response to hypergly- camic (20 mM) concentrations of glucose. Myo-inositol and sorbitol bebaved as compensating intracellular osmolytes by accumulating markedly in response to hyperosmolality (300 mM mannitol). Thus the pattern of response of myo-inositol to hyperglycemic and hyperosmotic levels of glucose and mannitol was related to the degree of basal aidone reductase gane expres- sion, which may therefore influence the development of diabetic complications."},{"spans":[{"offset":2190,"length":62}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[51,576,361,570,361,584,51,590]}],"content":"diabetic complications: osmoregulation; myo-inositol; sorbitol"},{"spans":[{"offset":2253,"length":1921}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[51,599,686,588,692,916,56,927]}],"content":"FOR OVER 20 years, stimulation of aldose reductase (AR2; EC 1.1.1.21) activity by mass action has been viewed as a critical link between hyperglycemia and the tissue damage underlying some chronic diabetic compli- cations (11, 16, 20). However, the modulatory role of AR2 gene expression in this process has not been ezten- sively explored (11, 18, 20, 36). Indeed, the view that AR2 is an important physiological intracellular osmo- regulator in the renal medalla, where it is strongly and specifically induced by extracellular hyperosmolality, has only recently emerged as part of a \"compatible os- molyte\" hypothesis (25). This hypothesis argues that nonionic [and therefore, \"nomperturbing\" (38)] com- pounds such as sorbitol, myo-inositol (MI), betaine, tau- Recently, stable lines of cultured human retinal pig- ment epithelial cells (RPE) have emerged as useful in vitro models for the study of some biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (9, 19, 27).
