Fuchs, and Salvatore V. Pizzo Depart ments of Pathology, Biochemistry and Surgery Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710 U.S.A.\n(Received 4.9. 1985; Accepted in revised form 12.12.1985 by Editor K.M. Brinkhous)\nABSTRACT\nAntithrombin III (ATIII) is an anticoagulant protein which binds and inactivates thrombin and other serine proteinases. Little is known about regulation of its synthesis. We confirm that ATIII is synthesized by isolated rat hepatocytes, and that its synthesis is not iltered by direct feedback of its complexes with proteinases. Neither is hepatocyte synthesis of ATIII altered by supernatants from macrophages cultured in the presence of ATIII- proteinase complexes. However, culture of macrophages with fibrinogen fragment . D results in production of a factor(s) in the macrophage supernatants which stimulates hepatic fibrinogen synthesis, as previously described, and also stimulates the synthesis of ATIII and aj-proteinase Inhibitor (a1PI). Synthesis of albumin and rat a2-macroglobulin (o2M) is not altered. Culture of macrophages in the presence of bacterial endotoxin also results in release of a factor(s) into the medium which stimulates the same changes in hepatocyte protein synthesis. These results show for the first time a mechanism by which synthesis of ATIII can be regulated during coagulation and fibrinolysis.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn order to maintain fluidity of circulating blood, yet allow for effective coagulation when required for hemostasis, the plasma levels of endogenous pro- and anticoagulant proteins must be regulated within narrow limits. Relatively little is known, however, about the mechanisms by which synthesis of most coagulation proteins is modulated. Antithrombin III (ATIII) is an anticoagulant protein which is the major inhibitor of activated clotting factors, particularly thrombin and IXa. ATIII binds to serine proteinases to form inactive ATIII-proteinase complexes (1). Binding is enhanced . in the presence of heparin. Much indirect evidence exists that ATIII is synthesized in the liver. Plasma ATIII levels fall when there is a loss of hepatic parenchyma (2,3).\nKey Words: fibrinogen synthesis, antithrombin Ill synthesis, @1-proteinase inhibitor synthesis, coagulation proteins,
