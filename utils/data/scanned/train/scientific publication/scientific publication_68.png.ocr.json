FRIEDMAN\nThere is considerable epidemiologic evi- dence suggesting an inverse relation be- tween dietary intake or blood levels of beta- carotene (provitamin A) and cancer. espe- cially lung cancer (1~6). Several studies have demonstrated that cigarette smokers have lower blood beta-carotene or carot- enoid levels than nonsmokers (7-10). Therefore, beta-carotene status as mea- sured by dietary intake or blood levels may be a confounding factor in the relation of cigarette smoking to lung cancer.\nPassive smoking has been linked with an increased risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers in a number of studies (11-17). To our knowledge, there have been no studies ex- amining the relation of beta-carotene sta- tus to passive smoking. We therefore con- ducted a cross-sectional study of current dietary carotene intake in a population of 2,142 nonsmokers for whom we collected information about passive smoking at home.\nMETHODS Study population\nThe study population consisted of the 2,142 nonsmokers in the group of 3,899\nKaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Oak- land, CA.\nReprint requests to Dr. Stephen Sidney, Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Pro- gram, 345] Piedmont Avenue, Oakland, CA 94611. This study was supported by grant RO1-CA36074- 04 from the National Cancer Institute and by a grant from the Alcohol Beverage Medical Research Foun- dation.\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Walter Willett for providing the food frequency questionnaire and for his helpful suggestions regarding the manuscript, to Mary Anne Armstrong and Bruce Fireman for statistical consultation, and to Harald Kipp for computer pro- gramming.\nKaiser Permanente Medical Care Program members who received multiphasic health checkups in Oakland, California, during 1985 and who satisfactorily completed self- administered research questionnaires re- garding tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and diet. The membership of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, which provides health care to approximately 25 per cent of the population of the San Fran- cisco Bay Area, is heterogeneous (18). Those who take multiphasic health check- ups are also heterogeneous but tend to be better educated and more health-conscious (19-20). Excluded from the study popula- tion were 766 nonsmokers who did not com- plete all the questions on the dietary ques- tionnaire.\nAssessment of passive smoking\nPassive smoking at home was ascer- tained by the response to the question on the tobacco use questionnaire, \"On the av- erage, how many hours per week are you exposed to cigarette, cigar or pipe smoke in your home because of smoking by others? (Write in 000 if less than 1 hour per week) ---- hours.\" This questionnaire was ad- ministered to Kaiser Permanente multi- phasic health checkup examinees between 1979 and 1986; a study of passive smoking based on the questionnaire has previously been published (21). Nonsmokers were classified as being exposed to passive smoke at home if the response to this question was greater than zero.\nAssessment of dietary carotene intake\nA 30-item semiquantitative food
