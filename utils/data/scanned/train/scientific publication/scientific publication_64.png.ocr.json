A germline TP53 splice donor mutation In exon 4 is present in all affected family members available for testing. The mutation abolishes correct splicing of intron 4 and techniques of RT-PCR 7 have identified three different aberrant transcripts from the mutant TP53 allele. Using the yeast functional 1 ussuy to analyse transcripts in cells from a number of family members with the mutant allele, TP53 appears wild-type. Functional studies have been carried out on cells from patients with and without cancer who carry the germline mutation, and on cells from unaffected individuals from the same family who do not carry the mutation. Using a number of functional endpoints known to distinguish between cells carrying mutant or J wild-type TP53 alleles, we were unable to discriminate normal (wt/wt) from heterozygous (wt/mut) cells by lymphocyte apoptosis and fibroblast survival following low dose rate lonising radiation exposure. However germline mutation carriers show increased sensitivity to 1 radiation-induced chromosome damage in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and decreased transient and permanent arrest. These studies demonstrate the importance of \"] fully characterising the effects of TPS3 germline mutations, and may explain some of the phenotypic features of this family.\nKeywords: Li-Fraumeni; TP53; splicing;\n1 Introduction\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is characterized by an unusual familial clustering of tumours including bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, early-onset breast cancer, brain tumours and leukaemias and childhood adrenocortical tumours (Li and Fraumeni, 1969; Li et al., 1988). The formal criteria for classic LFS are a proband with a sarcoma aged under 45 years, a first degree relative with any cancer under 45 years plus another first or second degree relative with\nCorrespondence: JM Varley Received 22 October 1997; revived 28 January 1998; accepted 29 January 1998\neither any cancer under 45 years or a sarcoma at any agc (Li et al., 1988). Some families which fail to meet the criteria for classic LFS have been termed Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL, Birch et al.,, 1994). These are defined by a proband with any childhood tumour or sarcoma, brain tumour or adrenocortical tumour under 45 years with a first or second degree relative with any typical LFS tumour at any age, plus another first or second degree relative with any cancer aged under 60 years. Around 70% of classic LFS and 20% of LFL families have been found to have germline mutations of the TP53 gene (Malkin et al., 1990; Birch et al., 1994; Varley et al., 1997a,b), and these mutations have been found throughout the gene. Many germline mutations described to date involve codons which are known to be vital for normal functioning of p53, whereas others may be inactivating mutations such as deletions or truncating mutations. In families with these types of germline TP53 mutation it is relatively safe to assume that the mutation is causative within the LFS family in which it was found. However in some other cases the significance of the germline TP53 mutation may be less clear-cut, particularly if the mutation has not previously been described or if the consequences of the mutation on transcription or translation are unclear. In such families it is essential to verify that the putative mutation does indeed confer altered function(s) on the transcript or protein product.\nWe have analysed the TP53 gene in a family which is Li-Fraumeni-like, and have detected a point mutation affecting the splice donor site of exon 4. The nucleotide involved is not one of the invariant splice-site residues, and is a silent mutation affecting the third position of codon 125 (ACG/gt-+AC4/gt, Thr-+ Thr). Cells from LFS cases have been reported to show abnormal responses to DNA damaging agents such as ionising radiation, including reduced apoptosis (Camplejohn et al., 1995), permanent G. arrest (Williams et al., 1997) and cell killing (Sproston et al., 1996), and increased chromosome damage in G2 cells (Parshad et al., 1993; Mitchell and Scott, 1997). These abnormalities may be a reflection of defective genome surveillance in p53-defective cells (Lane, 1992). We have used these assays to investigate the response of lymphocytes and fibroblasts from this family to examine the functional consequences of this mutation.\nThis article is for Individual use only and may not be further veproduced oc stored clostronically without written permission from the copyright holder, Unauthorized reproduction may reper in financial and oder penalides.

However in some other cases the significance of the germline TP53 mutation may be less clear-cut, particularly if the mutation has not previously been described or if the consequences of the mutation on transcription or translation are unclear. In such families it is essential to verify that the putative mutation does indeed confer altered function(s) on the transcript or protein product."},{"spans":[{"offset":4458,"length":939}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[338,662,595,657,600,857,342,863]}],"content":"We have analysed the TP53 gene in a family which is Li-Fraumeni-like, and have detected a point mutation affecting the splice donor site of exon 4. The nucleotide involved is not one of the invariant splice-site residues, and is a silent mutation affecting the third position of codon 125 (ACG/gt-+AC4/gt, Thr-+ Thr). Cells from LFS cases have been reported to show abnormal responses to DNA damaging agents such as ionising radiation, including reduced apoptosis (Camplejohn et al., 1995), permanent G. arrest (Williams et al., 1997) and cell killing (Sproston et al., 1996), and increased chromosome damage in G2 cells (Parshad et al., 1993; Mitchell and Scott, 1997). These abnormalities may be a reflection of defective genome surveillance in p53-defective cells (Lane, 1992). We have used these assays to investigate the response of lymphocytes and fibroblasts from this family to examine the functional consequences of this mutation."},{"spans":[{"offset":5398,"length":240}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[117,883,525,883,525,901,117,901]}],"role":"pageFooter","content":"This article is for Individual use only and may not be further veproduced oc stored clostronically without written permission from the copyright holder, Unauthorized reproduction may reper in financial and oder penalides.
