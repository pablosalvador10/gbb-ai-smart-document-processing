We now report that reversion of amino acid auxotrophies in E. coli fits that definition and is enhanced under conditions conducive to oxidative damage to DNA. Thus adaptive mutagenesis was ~ 4-fold more frequent in a sodA sodR strain than in the superoxide dismutase-replete parental strain and this mutagenesis was suppressed under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, a cell permeant manganic porphyrin, capable of catalyzing the dismutation of Oz. diminished the rate of occurrence of these mutations. Repair of oxidative damage to DNA, in the non-dividing cells, appears to provide the opportunity for adaptive mutagenesis.\nRadicals\nBenov, L. and Fridovich, I.\nMutation Research 357:231-236,
