Gunning, Ming You, and Andre Castonguay1 Department of Pathology (SAM, WTG, MY), Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio; and Laboratory of Cancer Etiology and Chemoprevention (AC), School of Pharmacy, Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada\nThe promotional effects of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) on tung tumorigenesis induced by 4- (methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) was evaluated in a two-stage model of lung tumori- genesis in the A/J mouse. Mice were treated in two separate experiments with 1.54 mmol/kg (9.1 mg/mouse) NNK, which induced an average of 8.4 and 9.1 tumors/mouse in the experiments. Animals fed a diet that contained 1 g/kg BHT after administration of the carcinogen in these two experiments demonstrated an increase of the tumor multiplicity by 63% and 43%. Multiplicity of forestomach tumors was not effected by BHT in the diet. No differences in lung tumor morphology were seen as a result of the promoting effect of BHT. Mutations in the Ki-ras oncogene from lung tumors induced by NNK (19 tumors) or by NNK plus a diet containing BHT (34 tumors) were characterized by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and direct sequencing. All 19 NNK-induced tumors not promoted with BHT contained acti- vated Ki-ras genes with GC-+AT transitions at the second base of codon 12. Only 11 of 34 NNK-induced and BHT-promoted tumors (32%) had this characteristic Ki-ras alteration. These data suggest that the NNK- initiated mouse lung tumorigenesis pathway, which involves the specific mutation of the Ki-ras oncogene, is altered to a predominantly non-ras mechanism when these tumors are promoted by BHT in the diet. 0 1994 Wiley.Liss, Inc.\nKey words: Tobacco, gastric tumors, Of-methylguanine, Clara cells, Type Il pneumocytes\nINTRODUCTION\nImportant environmental factors associated with the development of human cancers include tobacco smoking and diet [1]. Tobacco smoking is a well-established risk factor for lung cancer [2] as tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 compounds, of which 43 have been shown to induce tumors in laboratory animals (3,4]. The most potent carcinogenic agent contained in cigarette smoke is the nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3 pyridyl)-1- butanone (NNK), which has a remarkable specificity for lung tissues in laboratory animais [5] and has been sug- gested to be an important etiological factor in tobacco smoke-related human cancer [6]. NNK requires activa- tion, which occurs by a-hydroxylation and results in the formation of methylated DNA adducts [5,7]. Lung tumors induced by NNK in strain A/I mice primarily have Ki-ras mutations (GC-+AT transitions) at the second base of codon 12, although mutations have also been found at codon 61 with high doses of NNK [8,9]. The specific GC-+AT transitions at the second base of codon 12 have been reported to be the result of Of-methylguanine ad- duct formation [10]. In addition to inducing tumors of the lung, NNK was shown by Wattenberg and Coccia [11] to induce tumors of the forestomach in the A/J mouse at a dose level of 8 mg/mouse administered intragastrically.\nBesides tobacco and tobacco smoke, some components of the human diet are established risk factors for the de-\nvelopment of cancer [12]. Many foods in the North Ameri- can diet contain the antioxidant butylated hydroxytolu- ene (BHT). This antioxidant prevents oxygen-induced lipid deterioration by acting as a chain terminator of free radi- cal reactions. Therefore, BHT is used by the food process- ing industry as a preservative to prevent rancidity. It has been estimated that the average U.S. citizen consumes 1-2 mg BHT/d [13]. This compound has been known to be toxic in laboratory animals for more than 30 yr [14]. BHT has also been shown to promote lung tumors in mice [14-16]; however, its mechanism of action is unknown.\nThe purpose of the study presented here was to de- velop a two-stage model of mouse lung tumorigenesis using NNK, an environmentally important lung carcino- gen; to determine the effects of BHT on NNK carcino- genesis; and to investigate possible differences in oncogene activation in mouse lung tumors induced solely by NNK and from lung tumors induced by NNK and promoted by BHT.\n'Corresponding author: Laboratory of Cancer Etiology and Chemcprevention, School of Pharmacy, Laval

Mice were treated in two separate experiments with 1.54 mmol/kg (9.1 mg/mouse) NNK, which induced an average of 8.4 and 9.1 tumors/mouse in the experiments. Animals fed a diet that contained 1 g/kg BHT after administration of the carcinogen in these two experiments demonstrated an increase of the tumor multiplicity by 63% and 43%. Multiplicity of forestomach tumors was not effected by BHT in the diet. No differences in lung tumor morphology were seen as a result of the promoting effect of BHT. Mutations in the Ki-ras oncogene from lung tumors induced by NNK (19 tumors) or by NNK plus a diet containing BHT (34 tumors) were characterized by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and direct sequencing.
