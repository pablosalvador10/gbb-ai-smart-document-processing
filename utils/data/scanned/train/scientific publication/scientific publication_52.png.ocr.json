ROSS1+ Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Illinois,\" and Department of Surgery and Pathology, St. Luke's-Rush Presbyterian School of Medicine,2 Chicago, Illinois 60612\nReceived 11 March 1988/Accepted 29 April 1988\nTo examine the role of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T and small t antigens in tumorigenesis in animals, we generated transgenic mice which expressed either both the SV40 large T and small t antigens or the SV40 large T antigen alone under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat. The mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat directs the expression of transgenes in ductal epithelial cells of several organs, including the mammary gland, lung, and kidney, and in lymphoid cells. The mice which expressed both the T and t tumor antigens developed lung and kidney adenocarcinomas, while those which expressed large T alone did not. Both types of mice developed malignant lymphomas with similar frequencies and latency periods. Our results show that the SV40 small t antigen cooperates with the large T antigen in inducing tumors in slowly dividing epithelial cells in the lung and kidney.\nThere is substantial evidence that multiple events are required to achieve cellular transformation, including over- expression and mutation of cellular oncogenes. Several model systems have been used to study the cooperation between different oncogenes in cellular transformation by using both cultured cells and animals (4, 5, 20, 21, 23, 39, 49). Transgenic mice have also been used successfully to study tumor induction by cellular and viral oncogenes (33). The process of tumorigenesis in transgenic mice appears to require activation of cellular or humoral factors in addition to expression of the introduced oncogene(s) (1, 16, 32, 33, 43, 44).\nCooperation between transforming genes has also been extensively studied with simian virus 40 (SV40), a DNA tumor virus which encodes two genes expressed in the early stage of viral infection, large T antigen (94 kilodaltons) and small t antigen (17 kilodaltons) (47). These two proteins share common amino termini but differ at their carboxyl end because of differential splicing of a single transcript (2, 19). SV40 large T antigen is required for the normal virus lytic cycle, transformation of cells in tissue culture, or causing tumors in hamsters, since mutations in this region abolishes these properties (45). The role of small t antigen is not clear in either the transformation process or the viral replication cycle (45). Large T antigen alone seems to support efficient viral replication, but there has been a controversy about the role of small t antigen in transformation. Cells infected with wild-type or mutant SV40 or with recombinant retroviruses containing large T and small t, or large T alone, appear to be transformed with equal efficiency under certain experimental conditions (3, 8, 11, 12, 22, 41, 47), while under other conditions, both the large T and small t antigens have been shown to be necessary for this process (3, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18, 25, 38, 40, 43). In addition, when viruses with deletions in small t antigen are injected into newborn hamsters, the latency of fibrosarcomas is increased relative to wild-type viruses (27, 48).\nTo study the role of the SV40 early-region tumor antigens in tumorigenesis of different cell types and tissues, we introduced the large T and small t antigens into transgenic mice so that the antigens would be expressed in several different tissues. We made transgenic mice carrying both SV40 large T antigen and small t antigen under the transcrip- tional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) and mice containing the same transgene in which the small-t-coding sequences were dis- rupted, MMTV is an endogenous retrovirus in mice which is causally associated with mammary carcinomas and is ex- pressed at high levels in the lactating mammary gland (30). We and others have shown that genes placed under the control of the MMTV LTR are expressed in the lactating mammary gland and in several different tissues of transgenic mice (10, 24, 37, 44) and that this expression mimics that of the endogenous proviruses (16a). Expression of MMTV LTR hybrid genes appears to be limited to ductal epithelial cells in various organs, to lymphoid cells, and possibly to Leydig cells in the testes (10). We chose to use the MMTV LTR as a control element for expression of the SV40 early-region genes, because we could then direct their expression in several different cell types and tissues. In this way, we could compare, for example, the tumor-inducing ability of the SV40 genes in epithelial cells in lung, kidney, mammary gland, and salivary gland and in lymphoid cells, within the same and among different strains of mice. In an individual transgenic strain, the integration site and copy number of the transgene remains constant from tissue to tissue, and thus the ability of an oncogene to cause tumors is not dependent on viral infectivity or replication; a compari- son of the tumor-inducing ability of a transforming gene(s) can then be made in the different tissues where it is ex- pressed.\nWe found that four out of six independent transgenic strains of mice expressing both large T and small t antigen developed adenocarcinomas in the lung and/or kidney by 4 months of age, but none of the transgenic mice expressing only SV40 large T antigen developed adenocarcinomas in either of these tissues by the age of 6 months. All of the transgenic mice carrying either both large T and small t antigen or large T antigen alone developed malignant lym-\n* Corresponding author.\nPresent address: Institute of Cell and Tumor

These two proteins share common amino termini but differ at their carboxyl end because of differential splicing of a single transcript (2, 19). SV40 large T antigen is required for the normal virus lytic cycle, transformation of cells in tissue culture, or causing tumors in hamsters, since mutations in this region abolishes these properties (45). The role of small t antigen is not clear in either the transformation process or the viral replication cycle (45). Large T antigen alone seems to support efficient viral replication, but there has been a controversy about the role of small t antigen in transformation. Cells infected with wild-type or mutant SV40 or with recombinant retroviruses containing large T and small t, or large T alone, appear to be transformed with equal efficiency under certain experimental conditions (3, 8, 11, 12, 22, 41, 47), while under other conditions, both the large T and small t antigens have been shown to be necessary for this process (3, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18, 25, 38, 40, 43).

We made transgenic mice carrying both SV40 large T antigen and small t antigen under the transcrip- tional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) and mice containing the same transgene in which the small-t-coding sequences were dis- rupted, MMTV is an endogenous retrovirus in mice which is causally associated with mammary carcinomas and is ex- pressed at high levels in the lactating mammary gland (30). We and others have shown that genes placed under the control of the MMTV LTR are expressed in the lactating mammary gland and in several different tissues of transgenic mice (10, 24, 37, 44) and that this expression mimics that of the endogenous proviruses (16a). Expression of MMTV LTR hybrid genes appears to be limited to ductal epithelial cells in various organs, to lymphoid cells, and possibly to Leydig cells in the testes (10). We chose to use the MMTV LTR as a control element for expression of the SV40 early-region genes, because we could then direct their expression in several different cell types and tissues. In this way, we could compare, for example, the tumor-inducing ability of the SV40 genes in epithelial cells in lung, kidney, mammary gland, and salivary gland and in lymphoid cells, within the same and among different strains of mice. In an individual transgenic strain, the integration site and copy number of the transgene remains constant from tissue to tissue, and thus the ability of an oncogene to cause tumors is not dependent on viral infectivity or replication; a compari- son of the tumor-inducing ability of a transforming gene(s) can then be made in the different tissues where it is ex- pressed."},{"spans":[{"offset":5474,"length":456}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[393,816,686,816,686,919,393,919]}],"content":"We found that four out of six independent transgenic strains of mice expressing both large T and small t antigen developed adenocarcinomas in the lung and/or kidney by 4 months of age, but none of the transgenic mice expressing only SV40 large T antigen developed adenocarcinomas in either of these tissues by the age of 6 months.
