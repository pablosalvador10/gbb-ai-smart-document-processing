In a similar man- ner, we generated a series of conditionally active JunD) and c-Fos proteins by fusing their carboxyl (COOH)- terminal ends with a COOH-terminal fragment of the human estrogen receptor (KR) that contains the ligand- binding domain. JunD-ER (DER) and Fos-ER (FER) chi- meras with an intact leucine zipper and basic region exhibit hormone-dependent activation of activator pro- tein-1-directed transcription in transient expression as- says. One of these fusions, DER, has been examined in detail to determine its mechanism of action. Results from immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from DER and Fos transfected cells demonstrate that Fos and DER readily form heterodimer complexes. Sur- prisingly, the formation of Fos:DER heterodimers, and possibly DER homodimers, is estrogen-independent. However, gel shift assays clearly demonstrate that DNA binding to API sites by Fos:DER heterodimers or DER homodimers is estrogen-dependent. Moreover, in the ab- sence of estrogen, the DER protein is an effective inhib- itor of Fos-mediated transactivation, and this effect is reversed by the presence of estrogen. Our results indi- cate that the DER protein is a direct, hormone-revers- ible inhibitor of Fos and that estrogen controls the con- ditional positive or dominant negative activities of DER at the level of DNA binding to API sites. Accordingly, clonally derived fibroblast cell lines that stably express the DER protein exhibit reduced entry into the S phase of the cell eyele when quiescent cells are serum stimu- lated in the absence of estrogen. This is in contrast to the estrogen-treated controls. These results support the hypothesis that Al'1 is important for cell cycle progres- sion and provide a unique approach for examining the role of APJ in this process.\nMembers of the Jun and Fos families of oncoproteins are the essential components of the dimeric transcription factor acti- vator protein-1 (AP1).'

They are also sim- ilar in their interaction with c-Fos and Fos-related proteins (2). Jun:Jun or Jun:Fos dimer complexes bind to DNA at API sites and regulate the expression of target genes. Since jun and fos family members are rapidly induced in response to extracellu- lar growth signals, they are classified as immediate early re- sponse genes. Expression of these two gene families is an integral part of a well-orchestrated cascade of events leading to cellular proliferation (1 and 3,and references therein). Since Jun proteins are important participants in the cellular growth response, further studies analyzing the direct effects of these proteins on gene expression and cell growth would be greatly facilitated by a well characterized inducible expression system.\nOne approach for creating an inducible system focuses on placing the activity of a protein under the control of the ligand- binding domain of a steroid hormone receptor such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or the estrogen receptor (ER). Ste- roid receptor fusion proteins have been created with proteins such as EIA (4), c-Myc (5), the CCAAT/enhancer-binding pro- tein (6), Myol) (7), p53 (8), and e-Fos (9, 10). In each of these cases, the fusion protein appeared to be devoid of biological activity when expressed in cells in the absence of hormone, whereas its appropriate wild type (WI') function was restored in the presence of hormone.\nWe explored the possibility that the activities of WT and mutated Jun proteins could be regulated post-translationally by fusion with the KR. A JunD) chimeric molecule was created by appending a truncated human ER sequence to its 3' end resulting in the JunD-ER (DER) fusion. Analysis of the DER fusion protein shows that it is estrogen dependent for the activation of transcription from API reporter constructs. In addition, a detailed analysis of the mechanism by which estro- gen regulates the DER protein was performed. The chimera forms heterodimers with WT Fos proteins but does not readily form heterodimers with WI Jun proteins. However, neither the weak interactions between DEK and WT Jun nor the strong interactions between DER and Fos are regulated by estrogen.\nIn contrast, DNA binding by DER homodimers or DER:Fos heterodimers is completely estrogen-dependent. Because of this novel mechanism of action, the DER fusion protein is an effective dominant negative protein that complexes with Fos and reversibly inhibits its DNA binding activity. In addition, cell clones that stably express the DER protein exhibit a re- duced capacity to enter S phase from a growth arrested state in the absence of estrogen, a result that is consistent with the hypothesis that API is important for normal cell cycle progression.\nWhile a number of recombinant chimeras between steroid\nbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FHS, fetal bovine serum; TR, thyroid

In a similar man- ner, we generated a series of conditionally active JunD) and c-Fos proteins by fusing their carboxyl (COOH)- terminal ends with a COOH-terminal fragment of the human estrogen receptor (KR) that contains the ligand- binding domain. JunD-ER (DER) and Fos-ER (FER) chi- meras with an intact leucine zipper and basic region exhibit hormone-dependent activation of activator pro- tein-1-directed transcription in transient expression as- says. One of these fusions, DER, has been examined in detail to determine its mechanism of action. Results from immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from DER and Fos transfected cells demonstrate that Fos and DER readily form heterodimer complexes. Sur- prisingly, the formation of Fos:DER heterodimers, and possibly DER homodimers, is estrogen-independent. However, gel shift assays clearly demonstrate that DNA binding to API sites by Fos:DER heterodimers or DER homodimers is estrogen-dependent. Moreover, in the ab- sence of estrogen, the DER protein is an effective inhib- itor of Fos-mediated transactivation, and this effect is reversed by the presence of estrogen. Our results indi- cate that the DER protein is a direct, hormone-revers- ible inhibitor of Fos and that estrogen controls the con- ditional positive or dominant negative activities of DER at the level of DNA binding to API sites. Accordingly, clonally derived fibroblast cell lines that stably express the DER protein exhibit reduced entry into the S phase of the cell eyele when quiescent cells are serum stimu- lated in the absence of estrogen. This is in contrast to the estrogen-treated controls. These results support the hypothesis that Al'1 is important for cell cycle progres- sion and provide a unique approach for examining the role of APJ in this process."},{"spans":[{"offset":2430,"length":180}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[48,664,348,663,348,702,48,703]}],"role":"footnote","content":"Members of the Jun and Fos families of oncoproteins are the essential components of the dimeric transcription factor acti- vator protein-1 (AP1).'

Since jun and fos family members are rapidly induced in response to extracellu- lar growth signals, they are classified as immediate early re- sponse genes. Expression of these two gene families is an integral part of a well-orchestrated cascade of events leading to cellular proliferation (1 and 3,and references therein).
