Recent studies have indicated that eIF-4E acts as a protooncogene, but only in its phosphorylated state. In order to determine the role of elF-4E in on- cogenesis, we examined its regulation and expression in cloned rat embryo fibroblasts transformed with the Harvey ras (Ha-ras) oncogene. The expression of Ha- ras increased the rate of protein synthesis but did not increase the levels of eIF-4E mRNA or protein. How- ever, a dramatic increase (7-fold) in phosphate incor- poration into eIF-4E was observed. The percentage of eIF-4E in the phosphorylated state was the same in transfected and control cells, indicating that both phos- phorylation and dephosphorylation of eIF-4E were in- creased. Phosphopeptide mapping of elF-4E from > GREF T4 cells indicated a single site of phosphoryl- ation at Ser-53, which is the same as that identified previously in eIF-4E from reticulocytes and HeLa cells. These results indicate that p21\"\" is part of the signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of oIF-4E. These findings also provide a potential mech- anism for cell transformation by p21\"\" which involves the preferential stimulation of translation of certain mRNAs.\nThe H-ros-1, K-ras-2, and N-ros genes encode a group of closely related 21-kDa membrane-associated proteins, termed p21\"\", which have been extensively characterized (Barbacid, 1987). p21 *** is localized on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and exhibits guanine nucleotide binding and or- > change activities which are characteristic of G proteins (Bourne et al., 1990). These properties suggest a role for p21\"\" in signal transduction across the cell membrane. p21\"\" in the GTP-bound state is active, whereas p21\"\"-GDP is inactive (McCormick, 1989). Oncogenic ras genes are distinguished from their normal protooncogene counterparts by the pres- ence of one or more point mutations which stabilize the protein in an active complex with GTP. Expression of onco- genic p21\"\" is associated with increased cell proliferation, transformation, and differentiation (Durkin and Whitfield,\n1989). However, despite extensive characterization of the biological effects of oncogenic p21\"\", its effectors and mech- anism of action remain unclear. 2\nThe eukaryotic translation initiation factor (oIF-4EVis a 25-kDa polypeptide that binds to the 5' cap of mRNA af both a free polypeptide and as part of a complex termed elF-4F which also contains elF-4A and a 220-kDa polypeptide. The elF-4F complex acts at the step wherein mRNA becomes bound to the 43 S initiation complex. This step has been ? shown to be rate-limiting for protein synthesis under normal (e.g. nonvirus-infected) cellular conditions (reviewed in So- nenberg, 1988; Rhoads, 1991a). Recent evidence suggests & critical role for eIF-4E in regulating the overall rate of protein synthesis. elf-yf can modulate\n1\nOne way that the rate of protein synthesis can be modulated. is by the phosphorylation of GIF-45. elF-4E exists as a mix- ture of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in a number of systems, the major site of phosphorylation being Ser-53 (reviewed in Rhoads, 1991b). Conditions which inhibit protein synthesis, such as heat shock (Duncan et al, 1987) and mitosis (Bonneau and Sonenberg, 1987), cause a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF-4E. Conversely, an increase in eIF-4E phosphorylation has been correlated with stimulation of cells with numerous mitogens, including phorbol esters, serum, EGF, PDGF, and insulin (reviewed in Rhoads, 1991b). Closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals that it is the rate of elF-4E phosphorylation rather than the steady state level of phosphorylation that is best correlated with the rate of protein synthesis (Rychlik et al, 1990). Further evidence for rapid turnover of eIF-4E phosphate is provided by studies using okadaic acid which suggest a role for either proteiner phosphatase 1 or 2A (Rychlik et al, 1990; Donalson et al, 1991). It is not entirely clear how increased phosphorylation of eIF-4E increases the rate of protein synthesis, but insight into the mechanism is provided by in vitro studies which show that eIF-4E is only transferred to the 43 S initiation complex \\ in the phosphorylated state (Joshi-Barve et al., 1990).\nAnother way that eIF-4E may affect the rate of protein synthesis is by its level of expression. Expression of antisense RNA to eIF-4E mRNA inhibits protein synthesis in direct proportion to the decrease in eIF-4E levels (De Benedetti et al., 1991), whereas increasing the level of eIF-4E results in a phenotype similar to cells transformed with classical onco- genes (Lazaris-Karatzas et al., 1990; De Benedetti and\n.

Recent studies have indicated that eIF-4E acts as a protooncogene, but only in its phosphorylated state. In order to determine the role of elF-4E in on- cogenesis, we examined its regulation and expression in cloned rat embryo fibroblasts transformed with the Harvey ras (Ha-ras) oncogene. The expression of Ha- ras increased the rate of protein synthesis but did not increase the levels of eIF-4E mRNA or protein. How- ever, a dramatic increase (7-fold) in phosphate incor- poration into eIF-4E was observed. The percentage of eIF-4E in the phosphorylated state was the same in transfected and control cells, indicating that both phos- phorylation and dephosphorylation of eIF-4E were in- creased. Phosphopeptide mapping of elF-4E from > GREF T4 cells indicated a single site of phosphoryl- ation at Ser-53, which is the same as that identified previously in eIF-4E from reticulocytes and HeLa cells. These results indicate that p21\"\" is part of the signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of oIF-4E. These findings also provide a potential mech- anism for cell transformation by p21\"\" which involves the preferential stimulation of translation of certain mRNAs."},{"spans":[{"offset":2062,"length":888}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[77,637,392,634,394,833,79,836]}],"content":"The H-ros-1, K-ras-2, and N-ros genes encode a group of closely related 21-kDa membrane-associated proteins, termed p21\"\", which have been extensively characterized (Barbacid, 1987). p21 *** is localized on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and exhibits guanine nucleotide binding and or- > change activities which are characteristic of G proteins (Bourne et al., 1990).

Conditions which inhibit protein synthesis, such as heat shock (Duncan et al, 1987) and mitosis (Bonneau and Sonenberg, 1987), cause a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF-4E. Conversely, an increase in eIF-4E phosphorylation has been correlated with stimulation of cells with numerous mitogens, including phorbol esters, serum, EGF, PDGF, and insulin (reviewed in Rhoads, 1991b). Closer inspection of this phenomenon reveals that it is the rate of elF-4E phosphorylation rather than the steady state level of phosphorylation that is best correlated with the rate of protein synthesis (Rychlik et al, 1990). Further evidence for rapid turnover of eIF-4E phosphate is provided by studies using okadaic acid which suggest a role for either proteiner phosphatase 1 or 2A (Rychlik et al, 1990; Donalson et al, 1991). It is not entirely clear how increased phosphorylation of eIF-4E increases the rate of protein synthesis, but insight into the mechanism is provided by in vitro studies which show that eIF-4E is only transferred to the 43 S initiation complex \\ in the phosphorylated state (Joshi-Barve et al., 1990)."},{"spans":[{"offset":5121,"length":415}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[403,750,706,750,706,845,403,845]}],"content":"Another way that eIF-4E may affect the rate of protein synthesis is by its level of expression.
