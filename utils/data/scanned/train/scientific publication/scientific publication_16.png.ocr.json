Originally, the authors, like other students of the problem, had believed the results for the test to have a high rate of positivity, ranging from 83% to 97% in four reported studies.\" Evi- dently, however, such findings were a consequence of se- lection; initially, only \"overt\" cases of colonic cancer had been CEA-tested.\nIn their present report, Dhar et al found that the CEA test result was positive in 57 of 79 patients (72% ) in whom carcinoma of the colon was present at the time of assay. Patients with localized tumors had a low level of positivity (195%) compared to patients with metastatic disease (100% ). Thus, the results of the test give some indication of prognosis. Also, although a negative CEA test result fol- lowing tesection of cancer did not exclude the presence of residual neoplastic growth, a strongly positive result did indeed correlate with extensive carcinoma and poor prog- nosis.\nFurther clinical studies of antigenemia are needed to indicate the place of CEA tests and other similar procedures in diagnosis and prognosis of malignant neoplastic diseases. In addition, findings to date suggest the possibility of ex- perimental immunotherapy, a field ripening for investiga- tion. Where there an antigens, antibodies may be found.\n1. Zamcheck N.

Excessive sectetion of either hormone may follow one of two pathological changes. One is hyperplasia, induced in the case of hypercortisolism by high levels of pituitary adre- nocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or tarely by ACTH-se- creting carcinoma of a bronchus or other tissue. The stimulus for hyperplasia in aldosteronism has not been identified. The other pathological change is the development of an adrenal cortical tumor or tumors, usually a single benign adenoma, sometimes malignant, and occasionally ectopic. Tumor of one sort or another is the commonest cause of adrenal hyper- function, and it must be searched for in all cases. Because it may reside in either left or right adrenal, or infrequently in both, each must be investigated.\nEarly attempts at localization were made with roentgeno- graphic examination of the abdomen, following retroper- itoneal injection first of air and later of oxygen or carbon dioxide. Much better results are now obtained, and with greater safety, with phlebography and arteriography. These methods, however, have their drawbacks. Preoperative med.\nication is often required; catheterization of vessels must be performed by a team of skilled operators; occasionally rup- ture and hemorrhage of the small veins and arteries of the adrenal occur; and there is danger of serious reactions to the contrast medium.\nA promising improvement has recently been reported in a series of papers from the University of Michigan Medical Center. Following the demonstration in dogs that intra- venously injected 19-iodocholesterol tagged with iodine 131 (NM-145) was concentrated suficiently in the adrenals to permit scanning\", the procedure was employed successfully in the study of a patient with Cushing's syndrome.\" With use of 2 millicuries of NM-145, excellent visualization of the adrenals, obtained with a rectilinear photoscanner and an Anger camera, showed that both glands concentrated the isotope equally, thus allowing the diagnosis of hyperplasia and the absence of tumor. In a later publication\" two similar cases are reported, together with two other cases of Cushing's syndrome that are of interest. In one, an adrenocortical tumor was identified in the right gland with total suppression of uptake in the left; and in the other case, with symptoms pet- sisting after total adrenalectomy, the NM-145 study dis- closed a remnant of adrenal tissue that had been missed at operation. An elaborate extension of this method has been tied to measure adrenal function in patients without adrenal disease and in those with Cushing's syndrome.\"\nIn the March 1972 number of the Archives of Internal Medicine' the Michigan group reports the successful use of NM-145 to visualize aldosteronomis in four cases and dif- fuse hyperplasia in one patient with \"idiopathic\" aldoster- onism, ie, without tumor.\nThe test, apparently without hazard, is performed with an intravenous dose of about 2,000 microcuries of NM-145. The biological half-life is a little more than three days. Usual- ly, scanning has been done at this interval, but not until five, six, or eight to ten days in the aldosterone studies. In these, preinjection treatment with Lugol's solution has been given to block thyroidal uptake. The liver concentrates the isotope rather avidly soon after administration but largely rids itself in three days. Cells of the adrenal cortex and of cortical tumors appear to be the site of uptake, for pheochromo- cytomas have not been visualized by this method.\nThe early results of the Ann Arbor investigators in adrenal scanning with NM-145 justify similar trials in other in- stitutions.\nH.T.R\n1.
