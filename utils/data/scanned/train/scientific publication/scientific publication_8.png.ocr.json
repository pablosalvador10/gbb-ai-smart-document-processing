Stockwell,* Allan L. Goldman, Gary H. Lyman, Charles I. Noss, Adam W. Armstrong, Patricia A. Pinkham, Elizabeth C. Candelora, Marcia R. Brusa\nBackground: Exposure to environ- mental tobacco smoke (passive smok- ing) has been suggested to be a cause of lung cancer, although early epide- miologic studies have produced in- consistent results. Purpose: We conducted an epidemiologic case- control study to assess the relation- ship between exposure to environ- mental tobacco smoke and lung cancer risk among women who have never smoked (i.e., having smoked for a total of <6 months or having smoked <100 cigarettes in their life- times). Methods: Case patients (n = 210) were women with histologically confirmed primary carcinomas of the lung who were lifetime nonsmokers. They were identified through hospital tumor registries and the Florida Can- cer Data System of the Statewide Cancer Registry. Community-based - control women (n = 301) were also lifetime nonsmokers and were identi- = fied through random-digit dialing. Details on childhood and adulthood exposures to environmental tobacco smoke were ascertained through interviews with the study participants themselves or with surrogate re- spondents. Risks were calculated in terms of smoke-years, defined as the sum of the reported years of exposure or during social activities. No associa- to cigarette smoke from each smoker tion was noted for nonsmoking women\nin the household. Results: The risk of exposed to environmental tobacco lung cancer more than doubled for smoke during childhood. In contrast. women who reported 40 or more Janerich et al. (5) found that exposure to smoke-years of household exposure high levels of household smoke during during adulthood (odds ratio [OR] = childhood and adolescence doubled the 2.4: 95% confidence interval [CI] = risk of lung cancer among male and 1.1-5.3) or 22 or more smoke-years of female nonsmokers, whereas exposure exposure during childhood and ado- to smoke during adulthood was not as- lescence (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = sociated with an excess risk.

Con- clusion: These findings suggest that long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in women who have never smoked. [J Natl Cancer Inst 84:1417- Patients and Methods 1422, 1992]\nIn 1986, reports by the Surgeon Gen- eral (1) and the National Academy of Sciences (2) concluded that involuntary smoking can cause lung cancer in non- smokers. More recently, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health released a bulletin that reached similar conclusions (3). Several addi- tional studies have examined the rela- tionship between environmental tobacco. smoke and the development of lung can- cer in nonsmokers. In 1991. Fontham et al. (4) reported the results of the first 3 years of a large multicentered study of lung cancer risk among female lifetime nonsmokers. For nonsmoking women living with a spouse who smoked, there was a 50% increase in risk for develop- ment of lung adenocarcinomas. In addi- tion, there was a significant increase in risk for nonsmoking women exposed to environmental tobacco smoke at work\nA population-based case-control study was conducted in central Florida to examine the causes of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Women were elig- ible for inclusion as case patients if they had a histologically confirmed primary\nReceived February 24, 1992; revised May. 2. 1992; accepted June 5. 1992.\nSupported by Public Health Service grant CA-45513-05 from the National Cancer Institute.

Purpose: We conducted an epidemiologic case- control study to assess the relation- ship between exposure to environ- mental tobacco smoke and lung cancer risk among women who have never smoked (i.e., having smoked for a total of <6 months or having smoked <100 cigarettes in their life- times). Methods: Case patients (n = 210) were women with histologically confirmed primary carcinomas of the lung who were lifetime nonsmokers. They were identified through hospital tumor registries and the Florida Can- cer Data System of the Statewide Cancer Registry. Community-based - control women (n = 301) were also lifetime nonsmokers and were identi- = fied through random-digit dialing. Details on childhood and adulthood exposures to environmental tobacco smoke were ascertained through interviews with the study participants themselves or with surrogate re- spondents. Risks were calculated in terms of smoke-years, defined as the sum of the reported years of exposure or during social activities. No associa- to cigarette smoke from each smoker tion was noted for nonsmoking women"},{"spans":[{"offset":1509,"length":1492}],"boundingRegions":[{"pageNumber":1,"polygon":[296,156,682,160,679,461,293,457]}],"content":"in the household.
