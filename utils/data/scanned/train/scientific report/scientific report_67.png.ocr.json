Koch\nTitle of Original Grant: Nucleic Acid Photocleavage and Photocrosslinking to Associated Proteins\nOur specific aims are: 1) to identify the amino acid residue of the bacteriophage R17 coat protein to which a covalent bond is formed upon 308 nm XeCI laser excitation of the BrU chromophore of the JMW-15 variant RNA hairpin loop, 2) to test photocrosslinking to JMW-15 with proteins bearing mutations at or near the reactive amino acid residue which place other reactive amino acid residues in proximity to the BrU, 3) to identify the amino acid residue of the GA coat protein which crosslinks to JMW-15, 4) to participate with the Uhlenbeck group in modeling the R17 and GA bacteriophages, 5) to establish in collaboration with the Cech group the amino acid residues of the a and B-subunits of the Oxytricha nova telomere binding protein which photocrosslinks to specific BrU-substituted, synthetic, telomeric DNA of the form d(T4G4)4, 6) to participate with the Cech group in modeling the telomere binding region of the Oxytricha nova telomere binding protein, 7) to use the photocrosslinking technique with a BrU-substituted, synthetic DNA with the repeat TTAGGG to help identify the human telomere binding protein, again in collaboration with the Cech group, 8) to identify the structural requirements for BrU specific photocutting of RNA, and 9) to establish that photoreactivity from the BrU chromophore can be achieved in the absence of possible photoreactivity from the indole chromophore of tryptophan by excitation at 325 nm with emission from a HeCd laser.\nList all publications (author, title and journal) resulting from the current CTR award that contain a printed acknowledgment of CTR support.\nFor manuscripts, the designation \"in press\" means you have a preprint: otherwise use \"accepted for publication by .... \", \"submitted for publication to ... \" or \"in preparation.\" Do not list publications that do not acknowledge CTR support.\nWillis, M.
