Breath analysis of human exhaled air by an ultrasensitive laser detection device (LDD) will be used to quantitate lung cancer biomarkers. Prototype LDD systems will be used in a U.S. Clinical Trial conducted under an FDA-approved protocol to document the safety and effectiveness of lung cancer screening by breath analysis. The proposed program will be accomplished in three phases: 1 - Pilot clinical study, 2 - Clinical trial and FDA approval, and 3 - Commercialization. It is anticipated that early stage detection will decrease lung cancer mortality significantly in both smokers and non-smokers.\nBackground\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for an estimated 160,000 deaths in 1997[1]. Lung cancer is difficult to cure - the overall 5-year survival rate is only 13%[2], since metastasis has often occurred prior to diagnosis. Although the survival rate increases to 65% (Stage I) and 41% (Stage II) for non-small cell lung cancer cases (approximately 75 to 80% of primary lung cancer cases) detected in an early stage when the disease is still noninvasive[3], present screening procedures (chest X-rays, sputum cytology tests, etc.) are not sufficiently reliable to be used routinely and thus have had little impact on reducing mortality(4). A simple, effective, and inexpensive lung cancer screening procedure is needed for widespread early stage diagnosis in order to permit early stage treatment before invasive cancer develops.\nCigarette smoking is estimated to account for 80 to 90% of all lung cancer cases[5]. However, the remaining 10 to 20% incidence is due to other causes such as radon and occupational hazards (asbestos, etc.). In addition, not all smokers contract lung cancer - cigarette smoking is a risk factor for individuals who are genetically susceptible to the disease[5]. Ideally, genetically susceptible individuals should learn their status at the earliest possible time in order to prevent lung cancer by reducing behaviorial and environmental risks. In the absence of routine genetic susceptibility markers, the next best approach is to diagnose lung cancer disease at an early stage, thereby enabling high-risk individuals and their physicians to make informed decisions about therapy and, where appropriate, lifestyle changes such as cessation of smoking.\n2063607779\n-

Breath analysis of human exhaled air by an ultrasensitive laser detection device (LDD) will be used to quantitate lung cancer biomarkers. Prototype LDD systems will be used in a U.S. Clinical Trial conducted under an FDA-approved protocol to document the safety and effectiveness of lung cancer screening by breath analysis. The proposed program will be accomplished in three phases: 1 - Pilot clinical study, 2 - Clinical trial and FDA approval, and 3 - Commercialization.

Lung cancer is difficult to cure - the overall 5-year survival rate is only 13%[2], since metastasis has often occurred prior to diagnosis. Although the survival rate increases to 65% (Stage I) and 41% (Stage II) for non-small cell lung cancer cases (approximately 75 to 80% of primary lung cancer cases) detected in an early stage when the disease is still noninvasive[3], present screening procedures (chest X-rays, sputum cytology tests, etc.) are not sufficiently reliable to be used routinely and thus have had little impact on reducing mortality(4).
