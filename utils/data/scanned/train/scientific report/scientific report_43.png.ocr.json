Geranyl butyrate has been found to occur naturally in celery, kumquot, lemon oil, orange oil, and tomatoes (FEMA, 1985) . It has also been identified in the essential oil of Darwinia grandifolia and lavender oil as well as other essential oils (Opdyke, 1979) . Geranyl butyrate may be synthesized by the \"esterification of geraniol\" (Opdyke, 1979) . Based on a 1970 FEMA survey, it is reportedly used in foods at levels ranging from 0.03 to 23 ppm; based on these levels, a possible average daily intake of 4.13 mg was calculated (FEMA, 1985)
