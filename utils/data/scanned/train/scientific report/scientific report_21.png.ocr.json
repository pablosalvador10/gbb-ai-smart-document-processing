Shenton University of Georgia Athens, Georgia 30602\nM. A. Kastenbaum 16933 Timberlakes Drive, S.W. Fort Myers, Florida 33908\nSummary\nThe binomial probability parameter p (0≤ p ≤ 1) is taken to be a random variable with an assumed distribution. Mixtures are formed by assigning a probability structure to p, and the resulting binomial-type probability functions are shown to be finite binomial sums of certain Laplace transforms. Also a simple Laplace transform for the factorial moment, is presented that focuses attention on sample factorial moments as parameter estimators.\n1 Some key words: Binomial mixtures; Factorial moments; Laplace transforms ;; Moment estimators.\n1. Introduction\nFamilies of binomial distributions exist that are generalizations of Skellam's (1948) distribution, which treats the probability parameter p as a Beta random variable with density\nf (+) =pa-1(1 -p)8-1Γ(α +β)/(Γ(α) Γ(β)} (α, β > 0).\nFor n =1, . ... , the binomial becomes:\nΒ (x; n, α, β) = [p\"(1-p) ** f(p)dp (x=0, ... ,n) ...
