[Smoking Does Not Necessarily Lead to Lung Cancer]\" Washington Post -- Health (09/19/95) P. 12; Weiss, Rick\nDespite the claim that lung cancer is directly linked to smoking, about one in seven people diagnosed with the disease are nonsmokers. Although cigarettes are currently the single most preventable cause of cancer, 85% of smokers never contract lung cancer. Researchers say this may be because while one person may be especially sensitive to one carcinogen, he or she may be resistant to another, depending on the particular combination of genes the person inherited.\nMost carcinogens are usually benign when they are first inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. It is only when they come in contact with various activating enzymes in the body that the carcinogens become threatening, since some of the body's ordinary compounds can have an untoward effect on carcinogens and make them chemically unstable and electrically charged. Studies in molecular epidemiology have determined that cancer is the result of a complex interaction between gene makeup and environmental factors.\n\"Study: Food as a Cancer Preventive Drug [May Lower Chances of Lung Cancer]\" Washington Post -- Health (09/19/95) P. 15\nScientists have found that people with an increased risk of cancer due to a lack of certain enzymes that neutralize carcinogens may benefit from foods that supply those enzymes or increase the production of those enzymes in the body. In a study performed on rats exposed to a cigarette carcinogen, a dose of the PEITC enzyme, an inhibitor found in watercress, caused a 50% reduction in lung tumors, according to American Health Foundation director of research Stephen Hecht. Hecht said he and his researchers believe that a pill containing these types of inhibitor substances might be a way to reduce lung cancer in smokers who are addicted to cigarettes, but stressed that the best thing for people to do is to quit smoking.\n0\nWolf - please comment on this claimi.
