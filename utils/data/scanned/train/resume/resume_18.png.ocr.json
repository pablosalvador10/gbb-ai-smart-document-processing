BRUNO TEMPORARY PRESIDENT AND MAJORITY LEADER 43rd District (Rensselaer County and part of Saratoga County)\nState Senator Joseph L. Bruno was first elected to the Senate in 1976. Republican, Senator Bruno was elected Temporary President of the New York State Senate in January, 1995. As a legislative priority, he has highlighted the state's economy and has concentrated his efforts on programs to stimulate the creation of jobs, aid the growth of business and commerce and the reduction of personal taxes.\nIn 1977, Senator Bruno was appointed Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on the Impact of Taxes on Small Business. The subcommittee held several hearings in various parts of the state, and received input from numerous small business operators who were struggling to fight inflationary times-both as business people and as residents of New York State. Subsequently, Senator Bruno introduced a number of bills which directly affected various aspects of New York's Tax Laws.\nIn 1978, Senator Bruno was named Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Consumer Protection. The Committee not only produces legislation designed to protect consumers from fraudulent business practices, but strives to untangle and eliminate costly government overregulation which increases the cost of products and services for New Yorkers. Some of the most important measures to come out of the Committee under Senator Bruno's leadership have included the Motor Vehicle Warranty Replacement or Refund Act, commonly referred to as the \"Lemon Law, \" and the \"private right of action\" legislation authorizing private citizens to file suit against any firm engaged in false advertising or deceptive business practices.\nIn 1984, Senator Bruno was named Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Insurance. Senator Bruno's first year as Chairman saw New York in the grips of the \"Liability Insurance Crisis.\" Little Leagues and horse races were canceled and many schools, companies, cities, towns, and villages were forced to curtail activities because of the crisis. Senator Bruno drafted legislation that, among other things, prohibits mid-term cancellations, requires a 60-day notice of non-renewal, and provides that a judge may fine a plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorney if they proceed with a suit that has been deemed frivolous.\nIn 1986, Senator Bruno was named Vice Chairman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management. As Vice Chairman Senator Bruno proposed several pieces of legislation to help communities across the state deal with the ever-increasing problem of solid waste disposal. Most recently, he was instrumental in developing \"The Solid Waste Management Act of 1988,\" which lays the groundwork for state and local government and private industry efforts to institute a waste management approach that emphasizes reduction, recycling and reuse, followed by environmentally sound disposal programs.\nIn 1989, Senator Bruno was named Chairman of the Legislative Commission on Public-Private Cooperation. As Chairman, he was a leader in the fight to control government costs, increase government accountability, reduce costly state mandates, open up the budget process, end rent-regulation subsidies for The wealthy, increase New York's energy independence, and preserve the multi- billion dollar tax cut adopted in 1987.\n2044313535","pages":[{"pageNumber":1,"angle":1.179319977760315,"width":754,"height":1000,"unit":"pixel","words":[{"content":"MAY-08-1995","polygon":[84,89,159,90,158,104,84,103],"confidence":0.736,"span":{"offset":0,"length":11}},{"content":"14:31","polygon":[172,91,206,92,206,105,171,104],"confidence":0.985,"span":{"offset":12,"length":5}},{"content":"SENATOR","polygon":[262,93,310,93,309,108,261,107],"confidence":0.982,"span":{"offset":18,"length":7}},{"content":"BRUNO","polygon":[316,93,351,93,351,108,315,108],"confidence":0.954,"span":{"offset":26,"length":5}},{"content":"518","polygon":[524,98,546,98,545,112,523,111],"confidence":0.996,"span":{"offset":32,"length":3}},{"content":"455","polygon":[552,99,572,99,572,113,551,112],"confidence":0.997,"span":{"offset":36,"length":3}},{"content":"2448","polygon":[578,99,605,100,604,114,578,113],"confidence":0.989,"span":{"offset":40,"length":4}},{"content":"P.03","polygon":[624,100,655,101,655,115,624,114],"confidence":0.963,"span":{"offset":45,"length":4}},{"content":"JOSEPH","polygon":[314,164,365,166,365,181,314,180],"confidence":0.996,"span":{"offset":50,"length":6}},{"content":"L.","polygon":[373,166,387,166,387,181,372,181],"confidence":0.987,"span":{"offset":57,"length":2}},{"content":"BRUNO","polygon":[398,167,442,168,442,182,397,181],"confidence":0.996,"span":{"offset":60,"length":5}},{"content":"TEMPORARY","polygon":[213,190,291,191,291,207,213,206],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":66,"length":9}},{"content":"PRESIDENT","polygon":[299,191,373,193,372,209,299,207],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":76,"length":9}},{"content":"AND","polygon":[380,193,405,193,405,210,379,209],"confidence":0.998,"span":{"offset":86,"length":3}},{"content":"MAJORITY","polygon":[413,194,481,195,480,211,412,210],"confidence":0.985,"span":{"offset":90,"length":8}},{"content":"LEADER","polygon":[489,196,542,197,542,213,488,212],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":99,"length":6}},{"content":"43rd","polygon":[121,215,157,216,157,232,121,231],"confidence":0.969,"span":{"offset":106,"length":4}},{"content":"District","polygon":[164,216,232,217,231,234,164,232],"confidence":0.979,"span":{"offset":111,"length":8}},{"content":"(Rensselaer","polygon":[242,217,331,219,331,236,241,234],"confidence":0.982,"span":{"offset":120,"length":11}},{"content":"County","polygon":[339,219,388,221,387,238,338,236],"confidence":0.994,"span":{"offset":132,"length":6}},{"content":"and","polygon":[396,221,422,221,421,239,395,238],"confidence":0.998,"span":{"offset":139,"length":3}},{"content":"part","polygon":[429,222,463,222,462,240,428,239],"confidence":0.99,"span":{"offset":143,"length":4}},{"content":"of","polygon":[471,223,488,223,486,240,470,240],"confidence":0.996,"span":{"offset":148,"length":2}},{"content":"Saratoga","polygon":[497,223,564,225,563,242,496,240],"confidence":0.991,"span":{"offset":151,"length":8}},{"content":"County)","polygon":[572,225,632,227,631,244,570,242],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":160,"length":7}},{"content":"State","polygon":[60,256,104,257,104,272,60,271],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":168,"length":5}},{"content":"Senator","polygon":[114,257,173,259,173,274,114,273],"confidence":0.991,"span":{"offset":174,"length":7}},{"content":"Joseph","polygon":[182,259,233,260,233,275,182,274],"confidence":0.994,"span":{"offset":182,"length":6}},{"content":"L.","polygon":[242,260,257,260,257,276,242,275],"confidence":0.99,"span":{"offset":189,"length":2}},{"content":"Bruno","polygon":[268,260,310,261,310,277,268,276],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":192,"length":5}},{"content":"was","polygon":[318,261,343,262,343,278,318,277],"confidence":0.997,"span":{"offset":198,"length":3}},{"content":"first","polygon":[353,262,394,263,394,279,353,278],"confidence":0.982,"span":{"offset":202,"length":5}},{"content":"elected","polygon":[403,263,462,265,461,280,403,279],"confidence":0.995,"span":{"offset":208,"length":7}},{"content":"to","polygon":[471,265,488,265,488,281,471,281],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":216,"length":2}},{"content":"the","polygon":[498,265,523,266,523,282,497,281],"confidence":0.999,"span":{"offset":219,"length":3}},{"content":"Senate","polygon":[533,266,583,267,582,283,532,282],"confidence":0.993,"span":{"offset":223,"length":6}},{"content":"in","polygon":[593,268,610,268,609,284,592,283],"confidence":0.99,"span":{"offset":230,"length":2}},{"content":"1976.","polygon":[620,268,662,269,661,285,620,284],"confidence":0.89,"span":{"offset":233,"length":5}},{"content":"Republican,","polygon":[59,271,153,272,152,287,59,286],"confidence":0.957,"span":{"offset":239,"length":11}},{"content":"Senator","polygon":[165,273,224,274,223,289,164,288],"confidence":0.954,"span":{"offset":251,"length":7}},{"content":"Bruno","polygon":[234,274,275,275,275,290,233,289],"confidence":0.938,"span":{"offset":259,"length":5}},{"content":"was","polygon":[284,275,309,276,309,291,284,290],"confidence":0.999,"span":{"offset":265,"length":3}},{"content":"elected","polygo
