    "This notebook demonstrates a traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern architecture. We will use Azure AI Document Intelligence to scan multiple formats and complex layout documents, perform semantic chunking, and index the data into Azure AI Search for state-of-the-art retrieval capabilities. Finally, we will use GPT-4 for retrieving the information.\n",

    "+ **Keyword Search**: Traditional search method relying on direct term matching. Efficient for exact matches but struggles with synonyms and context. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-lucene-query-architecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: Converts text into high-dimensional vectors to understand semantic meaning. Finds relevant documents even without exact keyword matches. Effectiveness depends on quality of training data. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Reranking Search**: Fine-tunes initial search results using advanced algorithms for relevance. Useful when initial retrieval returns relevant but not optimally ordered results. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/semantic-search-overview)\n",
